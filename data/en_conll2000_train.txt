Confidence
in
the
pound
is
widely
expected
to
take
another
sharp
dive
if
trade
figures
for
September
, , O
due
for
release
tomorrow
, , O
fail
to
show
a
substantial
improvement
from
July
and
August
's
near
deficits
. . O

Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
Nigel
Lawson
's
restated
commitment
to
a
firm
monetary
policy
has
helped
to
prevent
a
freefall
in
sterling
over
the
past
week
. . O

But
analysts
reckon
underlying
support
for
sterling
has
been
eroded
by
the
chancellor
's
failure
to
announce
any
new
policy
measures
in
his
Mansion
House
speech
last
Thursday
. . O

This
has
increased
the
risk
of
the
government
being
forced
to
increase
base
rates
to
16
% NN
from
their
current
15
% NN
level
to
defend
the
pound
, , O
economists
and
foreign
exchange
market
analysts
say
. . O

`` `` O
The
risks
for
sterling
of
a
bad
trade
figure
are
very
heavily
on
the
down
side
, , O
'' '' O
said
Chris
Dillow
, , O
senior
U
economist
at
Nomura
Research
Institute
. . O

`` `` O
If
there
is
another
bad
trade
number
, , O
there
could
be
an
awful
lot
of
pressure
, , O
'' '' O
noted
Simon
Briscoe
, , O
U
economist
for
Midland
Montagu
, , O
a
unit
of
Midland
Bank
PLC
. . O

Forecasts
for
the
trade
figures
range
widely
, , O
but
few
economists
expect
the
data
to
show
a
very
marked
improvement
from
the
# # O
2
billion
-LRB
$ $ B
3
billion
-RRB
deficit
in
the
current
account
reported
for
August
. . O

The
August
deficit
and
the
# # I
2
billion
gap
registered
in
July
are
topped
only
by
the
# # I
2
billion
deficit
of
October
1988
. . O

Sanjay
Joshi
, , O
European
economist
at
Baring
Brothers
& CC
Co
, , O
said
there
is
no
sign
that
Britain
's
manufacturing
industry
is
transforming
itself
to
boost
exports
. . O

At
the
same
time
, , O
he
remains
fairly
pessimistic
about
the
outlook
for
imports
, , O
given
continued
high
consumer
and
capital
goods
inflows
. . O

He
reckons
the
current
account
deficit
will
narrow
to
only
# # I
1
billion
in
September
. . O

However
, , O
Mr
Dillow
said
he
believes
that
a
reduction
in
raw
material
stockbuilding
by
industry
could
lead
to
a
sharp
drop
in
imports
. . O

Combined
with
at
least
some
rebound
in
exports
after
August
's
unexpected
decline
, , O
the
deficit
could
narrow
to
as
little
as
# # I
1
billion
. . O

Mr
Briscoe
, , O
who
also
forecasts
a
# # I
1
billion
current
account
gap
, , O
warns
that
even
if
the
trade
figures
are
bullish
for
sterling
, , O
the
currency
wo
n
advance
much
because
investors
will
want
to
see
further
evidence
of
the
turnaround
before
adjusting
positions
. . O

Nevertheless
, , O
he
noted
, , O
`` `` O
No
one
will
want
to
go
into
the
trade
figures
without
a
flat
position
'' '' O
in
the
pound
. . O

Meanwhile
, , O
overall
evidence
on
the
economy
remains
fairly
clouded
. . O

In
his
Mansion
House
speech
, , O
Mr
Lawson
warned
that
a
further
slowdown
can
be
expected
as
the
impact
of
the
last
rise
in
interest
rates
earlier
this
month
takes
effect
. . O

U
base
rates
are
at
their
highest
level
in
eight
years
. . O

But
consumer
expenditure
data
released
Friday
do
n
suggest
that
the
U
economy
is
slowing
that
quickly
. . O

The
figures
show
that
spending
rose
0
% NN
in
the
third
quarter
from
the
second
quarter
and
was
up
3
% NN
from
a
year
ago
. . O

This
compares
with
a
1
% NN
rise
in
the
second
from
the
first
quarter
and
a
5
% NN
increase
from
the
second
quarter
of
1988
. . O

Mr
Dillow
said
the
data
show
the
economy
`` `` O
is
still
quite
strong
, , O
'' '' O
but
suggestions
that
much
of
the
spending
went
on
services
rather
than
consumer
goods
should
reduce
fears
of
more
import
rises
. . O

Certainly
, , O
the
chancellor
has
made
it
clear
that
he
is
prepared
to
increase
interest
rates
again
if
necessary
to
both
ensure
that
a
substantial
slowdown
does
take
place
and
that
sterling
does
n
decline
further
. . O

Thursday
, , O
he
reminded
his
audience
that
the
government
`` `` O
can
not
allow
the
necessary
rigor
of
monetary
policy
to
be
undermined
by
exchange
rate
weakness
. . O
'' '' O

Analysts
agree
there
is
little
holding
sterling
firm
at
the
moment
other
than
Mr
Lawson
's
promise
that
rates
will
be
pushed
higher
if
necessary
. . O

And
, , O
they
warn
, , O
any
further
drop
in
the
government
's
popularity
could
swiftly
make
this
promise
sound
hollow
. . O

Sterling
was
already
showing
some
signs
of
a
lack
of
confidence
in
Mr
Lawson
's
promise
Friday
. . O

In
European
trading
it
declined
to
$ $ B
1
and
2
marks
from
$ $ B
1
and
2
marks
late
Thursday
. . O

Economists
suggested
that
if
the
pound
falls
much
below
2
marks
, , O
the
government
will
be
forced
to
increase
rates
to
16
% NN
, , O
both
to
halt
any
further
decline
and
ensure
that
the
balance
of
monetary
policy
remains
unchanged
. . O

`` `` O

'' '' O
said
Bernard

logistics
professor

The
deregulation
of
railroads

trucking
companies

began

enabled
shippers
to
bargain
for
transportation

Carriers
could
use
their
equipment
more
efficiently

leading
to
overcapacity
they
were
eager

Shippers
cut
about

inter
truck

But

chairman
promised
Mr
Stone
a
decision
within
two
weeks
. . O

Bob
Stone
is
a
fictional
name
, , O
but
the
incident
described
is
real
. . O

It
happened
at
Northrop
Corp
in
Los
Angeles
. . O

The
court
is
called
the
Management
Appeals
Committee
, , O
or
just
`` `` I
MAC
, , O
'' '' O
and
it
is
likely
to
hear
a
couple
of
dozen
cases
a
year
. . O

Alter
some
details
of
this
example
and
it
could
be
taking
place
today
at
Federal
Express
in
Memphis
, , O
the
Defense
and
Underseas
Systems
divisions
of
Honeywell
in
Minneapolis
, , O
a
General
Electric
plant
in
Columbia
, , O
Md
, , O
or
a
number
of
other
companies
. . O

These
firms
are
pioneers
in
a
significant
new
trend
in
the
corporate
world
: : O
the
rise
of
what
I
call
corporate
due
process
. . O

Although
corporate
due
process
is
practiced
today
in
few
companies
-- : O
perhaps
40
to
60
-- : O
it
is
one
of
the
fastest
developing
trends
in
industry
. . O

In
the
coming
decade
a
majority
of
people
companies
are
likely
to
adopt
it
. . O

Corporate
due
process
appeals
to
management
for
a
variety
of
reasons
. . O

It
reduces
lawsuits
from
disgruntled
employees
and
ex
, , O
with
all
that
means
for
reduced
legal
costs
and
better
public
relations
. . O

It
helps
to
keep
out
unions
. . O

It
increases
employee
commitment
to
the
company
, , O
with
all
that
means
for
efficiency
and
quality
control
. . O

What
must
your
management
team
do
to
establish
corporate
due
process
? . O

Here
are
four
key
steps
: : O

1
. . O
Make
sure
you
have
a
strong
personnel
department
. . O

It
must
be
able
to
handle
most
of
the
complaints
that
can
not
be
solved
in
the
trenches
by
managers
and
their
subordinates
, , O
else
the
company
court
or
adjudicators
will
be
inundated
with
cases
. . O

At
Polaroid
, , O
the
Personnel
Policy
Planning
Committee
may
hear
only
about
20
cases
a
year
; : O
the
rest
of
the
many
hundreds
of
complaints
are
resolved
at
earlier
stages
. . O

At
TWA
, , O
the
System
Board
of
Adjustment
hears
50
to
75
cases
a
year
, , O
only
a
fraction
of
the
complaints
brought
to
personnel
specialists
. . O

At
Citicorp
, , O
the
Problem
Review
Board
may
hear
only
12
or
so
cases
because
of
personnel
's
skill
in
complaint
. . O

In
a
typical
year
, , O
up
to
20
% NN
of
the
work
force
goes
to
personnel
specialists
with
complaints
of
unfair
treatment
. . O

In
a
large
company
that
means
many
hundreds
of
complaints
for
personnel
to
handle
. . O

2
. . O
Formally
or
informally
, , O
train
all
your
managers
and
supervisors
in
the
company
's
due
approach
. . O

See
that
they
know
company
personnel
policy
backwards
and
forwards
, , O
for
it
is
the
`` `` I
law
'' '' O
governing
company
courts
and
adjudicators
. . O

Coach
them
in
handling
complaints
so
that
they
can
resolve
problems
immediately
. . O

In
case
managers
and
personnel
specialists
are
unsuccessful
and
subordinates
take
their
complaints
to
a
company
court
or
adjudicator
, , O
teach
managers
to
accept
reversals
as
a
fact
of
business
life
, , O
for
in
a
good
due
system
they
are
bound
to
happen
. . O

In
the
15
companies
I
studied
, , O
reversal
rates
range
on
the
average
from
20
% NN
to
40
% NN
. . O

3
. . O
Decide
whether
you
want
a
panel
system
or
a
single
adjudicator
. . O

A
panel
system
like
that
in
the
Bob
Stone
example
enjoys
such
advantages
as
high
credibility
and
, , O
for
the
panelists
, , O
mutual
support
. . O

An
adjudicator
system
-- : O
that
is
, , O
an
investigator
who
acts
first
as
a
fact
and
then
switches
hats
and
arbitrates
the
facts
-- : O
has
such
advantages
as
speed
, , O
flexibility
and
maximum
privacy
. . O

International
Business
Machines
and
Bank
of
America
are
among
the
companies
using
the
single
approach
. . O

4
. . O
Make
your
due
system
visible
. . O

It
wo
n
do
any
good
for
anybody
unless
employees
know
about
it
. . O

Most
managements
hesitate
to
go
all
out
in
advertising
their
due
systems
for
fear
of
encouraging
cranks
and
chronic
soreheads
to
file
complaints
. . O

On
the
other
hand
, , O
they
make
sure
at
a
minimum
that
their
systems
are
described
in
their
employee
handbooks
and
talked
up
by
personnel
specialists
. . O

Smith
Beecham
goes
further
and
sometimes
features
its
grievance
procedure
in
closed
TV
programs
. . O

Naturally
, , O
one
of
the
best
ways
to
guarantee
visibility
for
your
due
system
is
for
top
management
to
support
it
. . O

At
IBM
, , O
the
company
's
Open
Door
system
is
sometimes
the
subject
of
memorandums
from
the
chief
executive

Federal

goes
further
in
this
respect

any

I
know
of

Frederick
Smith

James
Barksdale

The
U
is
required
to
notify
foreign
dictators
if
it
knows
of
coup
plans
likely
to
endanger
their
lives
, , O
government
officials
said
. . O

The
notification
policy
was
part
of
a
set
of
guidelines
on
handling
coups
outlined
in
a
secret
1988
exchange
of
letters
between
the
Reagan
administration
and
the
Senate
Intelligence
Committee
. . O

The
existence
of
the
guidelines
has
become
known
since
President
Bush
disclosed
them
privately
to
seven
Republican
senators
at
a
White
House
meeting
last
Monday
. . O

Officials
familiar
with
the
meeting
said
Mr
Bush
cited
the
policy
as
an
example
of
the
sort
of
congressional
requirements
the
administration
contends
contribute
to
the
failure
of
such
covert
actions
as
this
month
's
futile
effort
to
oust
Panamanian
dictator
Manuel
Noriega
. . O

According
to
the
officials
, , O
Mr
Bush
even
read
to
the
senators
selections
from
a
highly
classified
letter
from
the
committee
to
the
White
House
discussing
the
guidelines
. . O

They
said
the
president
conceded
the
notification
requirement
did
n
affect
his
decision
to
lend
only
minor
support
to
this
month
's
Panama
coup
effort
. . O

No
notification
was
ever
considered
, , O
officials
said
, , O
apparently
because
the
U
did
n
think
the
coup
plotters
intended
to
kill
Mr
Noriega
, , O
but
merely
sought
to
imprison
him
. . O

What
's
more
, , O
both
administration
and
congressional
officials
hint
that
the
notification
requirement
is
likely
to
be
dropped
from
the
guidelines
on
coup
attempts
that
are
being
rewritten
by
the
panel
and
the
White
House
. . O

The
rewriting
was
launched
at
a
meeting
between
Mr
Bush
and
intelligence
committee
leaders
Oct
12
, , O
a
few
days
before
the
meeting
at
which
the
president
complained
about
the
rules
. . O

However
, , O
the
disclosure
of
the
guidelines
, , O
first
reported
last
night
by
NBC
News
, , O
is
already
being
interpreted
on
Capitol
Hill
as
an
unfair
effort
to
pressure
Congress
. . O

It
has
reopened
the
bitter
wrangling
between
the
White
House
and
Congress
over
who
is
responsible
for
the
failure
to
oust
Mr
Noriega
and
, , O
more
broadly
, , O
for
difficulties
in
carrying
out
covert
activities
abroad
. . O

A
statement
issued
by
the
office
of
the
committee
chairman
, , O
Sen
David
Boren
-LRB

, , O
Okla

, , O
charged
that
the
disclosure
is
part
of
a
continuing
effort
to
shift
the
criticism
for
the
failure
of
the
recent
coup
attempt
in
Panama
. . O

The
statement
added

`` `` O

Not
only
does
this
come
close

Sen

said

`` `` O
It

stop
bickering

work
together

clear
and
appropriate
policy
to

I
've
invited

to
send
his
suggestions
to

'' '' O

Republican
Sen
William
Cohen
of
Maine
, , O
the
panel
's
vice
chairman
, , O
said
of
the
disclosure
that
`` `` O
a
text
torn
out
of
context
is
a
pretext
, , O
and
it
is
unfair
for
those
in
the
White
House
who
are
leaking
to
present
the
evidence
in
a
selective
fashion
. . O
'' '' O

Sen
Boren
said
the
committee
could
n
defend
itself
by
making
the
documents
public
because
that
would
violate
classification
rules
. . O

But
the
chairman
and
other
committee
members
stressed
that
the
notification
guideline
was
n
imposed
on
the
White
House
by
a
meddling
Congress
. . O

Instead
, , O
both
congressional
and
administration
officials
agreed
, , O
it
grew
out
of
talks
about
coup
in
Panama
that
were
initiated
by
the
administration
in
July
1988
and
stretched
into
last
October
. . O

The
guideline
was
n
a
law
, , O
but
a
joint
interpretation
of
how
the
U
might
operate
during
foreign
coups
in
light
of
the
longstanding
presidential
order
banning
a
U
role
in
assassinations
. . O

In
fact
, , O
yesterday
the
administration
and
Congress
were
still
differing
on
what
had
been
agreed
to
. . O

One
administration
official
said
notification
was
required
even
if
the
U
`` `` O
gets
wind
'' '' O
of
somebody
else
's
coup
plans
that
seem
likely
to
endanger
a
dictator
's
life
. . O

But
a
congressional
source
close
to
the
panel
said
the
rule
only
covered
coup
plans
directly
involving
the
U
. . O

Although
the
notification
guideline
was
n
carried
out
in
this
month
's
coup
attempt
, , O
some
administration
officials
argue
that
it
may
have
led
to
hesitation
and
uncertainty
on
the
part
of
U
intelligence
and
military
operatives
in
Panama
. . O

One
senior
administration
official
called
the
guideline
`` `` O
outrageous
'' '' O
and
said
it
could
make
U
operatives
reluctant
to
even
listen
to
coup
plans
for
fear
they
may
get
into
legal
trouble
. . O

The
issue
came
to
a
head
last
year
, , O
officials
recalled
, , O
partly
because
the
Reagan
administration
had
sought
unsuccessfully
to
win
committee
approval
of
funding
for
new
Panama
coup
efforts
. . O

In
addition
, , O
both
administration
and
congressional
officials
said
the
need
for
guidelines
on
coups
and
assassinations
was
partly
spurred
by
a
White
House
desire
to
avoid
nasty
overseas
surprises
during
the
election
campaign
. . O

Though
the
assassination
ban
is
a
White
House
order
that
Congress
never
voted
on
, , O
the
intelligence
committees
can
exercise
influence
over
its
interpretation
. . O

Last
week
, , O
Central
Intelligence
Agency
Director
William
Webster
publicly
called
on
Congress
to
provide
new
interpretations
of
the
assassination
order
that
would
permit
the
U
more
freedom
to
act
in
coups
. . O

The
administration
has
reacted
to
criticism
that
it
mishandled
the
latest
coup
attempt
by
seeking
to
blame
Congress
for
restrictions
the
White
House
said
have
hampered
its
freedom
of
action
. . O

However
, , O
last
week
Mr
Webster
's
two
top
CIA
deputies
said
congressional
curbs
had
n
hampered
the
spy
agency
's
role
in
the
coup
attempt
in
Panama
. . O

Nevertheless
, , O
the
administration
's
criticisms
appeared
to
have
made
some
headway
with
Sens
Boren
and
Cohen
after
their
Oct
12
meeting
with
the
president
. . O

The
three
men
agreed
to
rewrite
the
guidelines
, , O
without
changing
the
basic
assassination
ban
, , O
to
clear
up
any
ambiguities
that
may
have
hampered
U
encouragement
of
coups
against
anti
leaders
. . O

The
new
argument
over
the
notification
guideline
, , O
however
, , O
could
sour
any
atmosphere
of
cooperation
that
existed
. . O

The

His

But
going
against
the
grain
has
never
bothered
Mr
Andersson
. . O

Stroking
his
trademark
white
goatee
during
a
recent
interview
, , O
the
diminutive
Swede
quips
: : O
`` `` O
It
turned
out
to
be
lucky
for
us

If
the
whole
market
thinks
what
you

doing

you
do

have
much
competition

'' '' O

Mr
Andersson
is
anxious
to
strengthen
Trelleborg
's
balance
sheet
. . O

Characteristically
, , O
he
did
n
waste
much
time
getting
started
. . O

On
Tuesday
, , O
Trelleborg
's
directors
announced
plans
to
spin
off
two
big
divisions
-- : O
minerals
processing
, , O
and
building
and
distribution
-- : O
as
separately
quoted
companies
on
Stockholm
's
Stock
Exchange
. . O

At
current
market
prices
, , O
the
twin
public
offerings
to
be
completed
next
year
would
add
an
estimated
2
billion
Swedish
kronor
-LRB
$ $ B
386
million
-RRB
to
Trelleborg
's
coffers
, , O
analysts
say
. . O

The
board
had
also
been
expected
to
approve
a
SKr1
billion
international
offering
of
new
Trelleborg
shares
. . O

But
that
share
issue
-- : O
intended
to
make
Trelleborg
better
known
among
international
investors
-- : O
was
postponed
until
market
conditions
stabilize
, , O
people
familiar
with
the
situation
say
. . O

Trelleborg
's
internationally
traded
`` `` B
Bfree
'' '' I
series
stock
plunged
SKr29
-LRB
$ $ B

-RRB
to
SKr205
-LRB
$ $ B
31
-RRB
in
volatile
trading
Monday
in
Stockholm
. . O

Tuesday
, , O
the
shares
regained
SKr20
, , O
closing
at
SKr225
. . O

Mr
Andersson
says
he
is
confident
that
taking
parts
of
the
company
public
will
help
erase
the
`` `` I
conglomerate
stigma
'' '' O
that
has
held
down
Trelleborg
's
share
price
. . O

Trelleborg
plans
to
remain
the
dominant
shareholder
with
stakes
of
slightly
less
than
50
% NN
of
both
units
. . O

The
spinoff
should
solve
a
problem
for
the
parent
. . O

A
family
foundation
set
up
by
late
founder
Henry
Dunker
controls
59
% NN
of
Trelleborg
's
voting
shares
outstanding
. . O

But
the
foundation
bylaws
require
the
entire
Trelleborg
stake
to
be
sold
in
the
open
market
if
control
drops
below
50
% NN
. . O

That
possibility
had
crept
closer
as
repeated
new
share
offerings
to
finance
Trelleborg
's
rapid
growth
steadily
diluted
the
foundation
's
holding
. . O

That
growth
is
the
result
of
Mr
Andersson
's
shopping
spree
, , O
during
which
he
has
bought
and
sold
more
than
100
companies
during
the
past
five
years
. . O

Most
of
the
new
additions
were
barely
profitable
, , O
if
not
outright
loss
makers
. . O

Applying
prowess
gained
during
earlier
stints
at
appliance
maker
AB
Electrolux
, , O
Mr
Andersson
and
a
handful
of
loyal
lieutenants
aggressively
stripped
away
dead
wood
-- : O
and
got
quick
results
. . O

The
treatment
turned
Trelleborg
into
one
of
Scandinavia
's
biggest
and
fastest
industrial
concerns
. . O

Between
1985
and
1988
, , O
sales
multipled
more
than
10
times
and
pretax
profit
surged
almost
twelvefold
. . O

Many
analysts
expect
Mr
Andersson
, , O
who
owns
1
% NN
of
the
company
, , O
to
be
named
Trelleborg
's
new
chairman
when
Ernst
Herslow
steps
down
next
year
. . O

But
the
promotion
is
n
likely
to
alter
a
management
style
Mr
Andersson
describes
as
`` `` O
being
the
driving
force
leading
the
troops
, , O
not
managing
by
sitting
back
with
a
cigar
waiting
for
people
to
bring
me
ideas
. . O
'' '' O

Last
month
, , O
in
his
boldest
move
yet
, , O
Mr
Andersson
and
Trelleborg
joined
forces
with
Canada
's
Noranda
Inc
in
a
joint
$ $ I
2
billion
hostile
takeover
of
another
big
Canadian
mining
concern
, , O
Falconbridge
Ltd
. . O

Industry
analysts
suggest
that
the
conquest
of
Falconbridge
could
vault
Trelleborg
from
a
regional
Scandinavian
success
story
to
a
world
mining
concern
. . O

`` `` O
Trelleborg
is
n
in
the
same
league
yet
as
mining
giants
such
as
RTZ
Corp
or
Anglo
Corp
, , O
'' '' O
says
Mike
Kurtanjek
, , O
a
mining
analyst
at
James
Capel
& CC
Co
, , O
London
. . O

`` `` O
But
we
certainly
like
what
we
've
seen
so
far
. . O
'' '' O

But
Trelleborg
still
must
clear
some
tough
hurdles
. . O

Mr
Andersson
acknowledges
that
the
company
's
mining
division
`` `` O
will
be
busy
for
a
while
digesting
its
recent
expansion
. . O
'' '' O

Booming
metals
prices
have
fueled
Trelleborg
's
recent
profit
surge
, , O
raising
mining
's
share
of
pretax
profit
to
68
% NN
this
year
from
a
big
loss
two
years
earlier
. . O

But
analysts
caution
an
expected
fall
in
metal
prices
next
year
could
slow
profit
growth
. . O

Mining
is
likely
to
remain
Trelleborg
's
main
business
. . O

Analysts
say
its
chances
of
success
will
likely
hinge
on
how
well
Trelleborg
manages
to
cooperate
with
Noranda
in
the
Falconbridge
venture
. . O

Noranda
and
Trelleborg
each
came
close
to
winning
Falconbridge
alone
before
the
successful
joint
bid
. . O

Some
analysts
say
Noranda
would
prefer
to
break
up
Falconbridge
, , O
and
that
the
Swedes
-- : O
relatively
inexperienced
in
international
mining
operations
-- : O
could
have
problems
holding
their
own
with
a
much
bigger
partner
like
Noranda
operating
on
its
home
turf
. . O

Mr
Andersson
insists
that
Trelleborg
and
Noranda
have
n
discussed
a
Falconbridge
break
. . O

Falconbridge
, , O
he
says
, , O
will
continue
operating
in
its
current
form
. . O

`` `` O
We
'd
be
reluctant
to
accept
50
ownership
in
a
manufacturing
company
. . O

But
such
partnerships
are
common
in
mining
, , O
where
there
are
n
problems
or
conflict
of
interest
or
risk
of
cheating
by
a
partner
, , O
'' '' O
Trelleborg
's
president
says
. . O

Perhaps
more
important
, , O
both
companies
share
Mr
Andersson
's
belief
in
the
coming
renaissance
of
base
industries
. . O

`` `` O
If
the
1980s
were
a
decade
of
consumption
, , O
the
'90s
will
be
the
investment
decade

'' '' O
Mr
Andersson
says

`` `` O
The

suffering
from

breakdown

`` `` O

to
$ $ I
1
billion
. . O

The
privatization
program
is
designed
to
rid
the
government
of
hundreds
of
assets
and
to
raise
critically
needed
funds
. . O

Much
of
the
money
from
the
sales
is
earmarked
for
a
multibillion
agrarian
program
. . O

But
efforts
have
been
thwarted
by
official
indifference
, , O
bureaucratic
resistance
, , O
a
legal
system
that
operates
at
a
snail
's
pace
, , O
political
opposition
and
government
misjudgments
. . O

Most
recently
, , O
a
lack
of
buyers
has
been
added
to
the
list
. . O

Rather
than
gathering
momentum
, , O
the
program
is
in
danger
of
slowing
even
more
as
the
government
tackles
several
big
assets
. . O

The
axiom
appears
to
be
that
the
more
valuable
the
asset
, , O
the
harder
the
privatization
process
. . O

`` `` O
You
just
do
n
see
a
whole
lot
happening
, , O
'' '' O
says
an
international
economist
. . O

To
be
sure
, , O
the
program
has
n
completely
stalled
. . O

The
Asset
Privatization
Trust
, , O
the
agency
chiefly
responsible
for
selling
government
properties
, , O
has
recorded
sales
of
more
than
$ $ I
500
million
since
it
began
functioning
in
December
1986
. . O

But
its
success
has
been
largely
in
the
sale
of
small
, , I
nonperforming
companies
, , O
which
are
valued
for
their
assets
. . O

Dealing
with
the
sales
this
month
could
be
particularly
challenging
because
almost
every
problem
that
has
hobbled
the
program
in
the
past
is
popping
up
again
. . O

Ramon
Garcia
, , O
the
Asset
Trust
's
executive
trustee
, , O
admits
to
what
he
calls
`` `` O
temporary
setbacks
. . O
'' '' O

In
light
of
the
poor
results
recently
, , O
he
says
, , O
the
agency
is
adopting
an
`` `` I
attitude
of
flexibility
. . O
'' '' O

October
's
troubles
began
when
the
trust
failed
to
sell
a
state
commercial
bank
, , O
Associated
Bank
, , O
for
the
minimum
price
of
671
million
pesos
-LRB
$ $ B
31
million
-RRB
. . O

At
the
end
of
the
month
, , O
the
agency
again
will
offer
the
bank
. . O

But
instead
of
a
minimum
price
, , O
only
a
target
price
will
be
established
. . O

Bankers
say
, , O
however
, , O
that
the
government
may
have
difficulty
selling
the
institution
even
without
a
floor
price
. . O

The
bank
has
a
negative
net
worth
, , O
they
say
. . O

In
addition
, , O
special
bidding
rules
give
the
bank
's
former
owner
, , O
Leonardo
Ty
, , O
the
right
to
match
the
highest
bid
. . O

Mr
Ty
lost
control
to
the
government
in
1980
when
a
government
bank
made
emergency
loans
to
the
cash
institution
. . O

In
1983
, , O
the
loans
were
converted
into
equity
, , O
giving
Manila
98
% NN
of
the
bank
, , O
but
with
the
understanding
that
Mr
Ty
had
repurchase
rights
. . O

His
ability
to
match
any
bid
has
scared
off
many
potential
buyers
. . O

Separately
, , O
the
government
will
try
again
within
a
month
to
sell
the
36
% NN
stake
in
Paper
Industries
Corp
of
the
Philippines
, , O
or
Picop
, , O
as
the
paper
mill
is
known
. . O

The
price
will
depend
on
how
much
Picop
shares
fetch
on
the
local
stock
market
. . O

But
according
to
bankers
and
stock
analysts
who
have
studied
the
paper
mill
, , O
price
is
n
the
only
consideration
. . O

As
it
stands
now
, , O
the
government
would
continue
to
hold
45
% NN
of
Picop
after
the
36
% NN
stake
is
sold
. . O

-LRB
About
7
% NN
of
Picop
is
publicly
traded
and
other
shareholders
own
the
rest
of
the
equity
. . O
-RRB

Potential
buyers
, , B
mostly
foreign
companies
, , O
are
reluctant
to
take
a
non
stake
in
a
company
that
, , O
by
the
government
's
own
reckoning
, , O
needs
some
$ $ I
100
million
in
new
capital
for
rehabilitation
. . O

The
prospect
of
buying
into
a
cash
company
without
getting
management
control
persuaded
at
least
three
foreign
buyers
, , O
including
a
member
of
the
Elders
group
of
Australia
, , O
to
pull
out
of
the
bidding
, , O
the
bankers
and
analysts
say
. . O

Mr
Garcia
acknowledges
the
problem
and
says
the
Asset
Trust
will
study
why
the
bidding
failed
and
what
changes
the
agency
may
be
able
to
offer
. . O

Under
government
regulations
, , O
however
, , O
foreign
ownership
of
Picop
's
equity
is
limited
to
40
% NN
. . O

Even
though
the
government
would
retain
the
45
% NN
stake
in
Picop
, , O
critics
have
accused
the
trust
of
selling
out
to
foreigners
. . O

A
series
of
newspaper
articles
accused
the
trust
of
short
the
government
over
the
Picop
sale
. . O

Mr
Garcia
says
he
has
been
notified
of
congressional
hearings
on
the
Picop
bidding
and
possible
legislation
covering
the
paper
mill
's
sale
, , O
both
prompted
by
the
criticism
of
the
agency
. . O

The
question
of
control
could
further
hinder
long
plans
for
the
government
to
divest
itself
of
Philippine
Airlines
, , O
in
which
it
has
a
99
% NN
stake
. . O

The
carrier
has
valuable
trans
and
Asian
routes
but
it
remains
debt
and
poorly
managed
. . O

This
maker

Guillermo

Sept

Americas
column
, , O
`` `` O
Mexico
's
Been
Bitten
by
the
Privatization
Bug
, , O
'' '' O
is
a
refreshingly
clear
statement
of
his
government
's
commitment
to
privatization
, , O
and
must
be
welcomed
as
such
by
all
Americans
who
wish
his
country
well
. . O

The
Mexico
States
Institute
is
glad
to
see
such
a
high
official
as
Mexico
's
undersecretary
of
finance
view
his
country
's
reforms
`` `` O
in
the
context
of
a
larger
, , I
world
process
'' '' O
of
profound
change
toward
free
economics
, , O
especially
in
the
statist
countries
. . O

Having
said
that
, , O
we
must
caution
against
an
apparent
tendency
to
overstate
the
case
. . O

It
is
not
quite
true
, , O
for
example
, , O
that
the
Mexican
government
has
`` `` I
privatized
'' '' O
Mexicana
de
Aviacion
, , O
as
Mr
Ortiz
claims
. . O

In
the
same
sentence
he
contradicts
himself
when
he
reports
that
the
government
still
retains
40
% NN
of
the
total
equity
of
the
airline
. . O

How
can
a
company
be
considered
`` `` O
privatized
'' '' O
if
the
state
is
so
heavily
represented
in
it
? . O

-LRB
True
, , O
the
Mexican
government
has
granted
`` `` B
control
'' '' O
over
the
airline
to
a
new
private
consortium
, , O
but
its
propensity
to
take
back
what
it
gives
is
too
well
known
to
permit
one
to
be
sanguine
. . O
-RRB

Regrettably
, , O
too
, , O
Mr
Ortiz
resorts
to
the
familiar
`` `` I
numbers
game
'' '' O
when
he
boasts
that
`` `` O
fewer
than
392
-LCB
state
enterprises
-RCB
currently
remain
in
the
public
sector
, , O
'' '' O
down
from
the
`` `` I
1
public
entities
that
existed
in
1982
. . O

'' '' O
But
the
enterprises
still
in
state
hands
include
the
biggest
and
most
economically
powerful
ones
in
Mexico
; : O
indeed
, , O
they
virtually
constitute
the
economic
infrastructure
. . O

I
refer
essentially
to
petroleum
, , O
electric
power
, , O
banking
and
newsprint
. . O

Those
enterprises
, , O
however
, , O
are
not
going
to
be
privatized
. . O

They
are
officially
considered
`` `` O
strategic
, , O
'' '' O
and
their
privatization
is
prohibited
by
the
Mexican
Constitution
. . O

In
language
that
sidesteps
the
issue
, , O
Mr
Ortiz
writes
, , O
`` `` O
The
divestiture
of
nonpriority
and
nonstrategic
public
enterprises
is
an
essential
element
of
President
Carlos
Salinas
's
plan
to
modernize
Mexico
's
economy
... : O
. . O
'' '' O

Yet
clearly
, , O
modernization
must
embrace
its
key
industries
before
it
can
be
said
to
have
caught
the
`` `` I
privatization
bug
. . O
'' '' O

The
bottom
line
, , O
however
, , O
is
not
economic
but
political
reform
. . O

A
long
succession
of
Mexican
presidents
arbitrarily
nationalized
whatever
industry
they
took
a
fancy
to
, , O
without
having
to
answer
to
the
public
. . O

To
guarantee
that
Mexicana
de
Aviacion
and
other
companies
will
really
be
privatized
, , O
Mexico
needs
a
pluri
political
system
that
will
ensure
democracy
and
hence
accountability

The
board
of

concern
voted
to
suspend
payment
of

quarterly

cents
a

The

also

it
expects
a

profitability
in
the
third
quarter
when
it
reports
operating
results
this

Ponce

said
the
dividend
was
suspended
in
anticipation
of

stringent
capital
requirements
under
the
Financial
Institutions
Reform
, , I
Recovery
, , I
and
Enforcement
Act
of
1989
. . O

A
labor
group
is
preparing
a
revised
buy
bid
for
United
Airlines
parent
UAL
Corp
that
would
transfer
majority
ownership
to
employees
while
leaving
some
stock
in
public
hands
, , O
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
group
. . O

The
group
has
been
discussing
a
proposal
valued
in
a
range
of
$ $ B
225
to
$ $ I
240
a
share
, , O
or
$ $ B
5
billion
to
$ $ I
5
billion
. . O

But
to
avoid
the
risk
of
rejection
, , O
the
group
does
n
plan
to
submit
the
plan
formally
at
a
UAL
board
meeting
today
. . O

Instead
, , O
the
group
is
raising
the
proposal
informally
to
try
to
test
the
board
's
reaction
. . O

People
familiar
with
the
company
say
the
board
is
n
likely
to
give
quick
approval
to
any
offer
substantially
below
the
$ $ I
300
, , I
$ $ I
6
billion
buy
bid
that
collapsed
last
week
after
banks
would
n
raise
needed
loans
and
after
a
key
partner
, , O
British
Airways
PLC
, , O
dropped
out
. . O

In
composite
trading
Friday
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
, , O
UAL
closed
at
$ $ B
168
a
share
, , O
down
$ $ B
21
. . O

But
the
pilots
union
, , O
which
has
been
pushing
for
a
takeover
since
1987
, , O
appears
to
be
pressing
ahead
with
the
revised
bid
to
avoid
further
loss
of
momentum
even
though
it
has
n
found
a
partner
to
replace
British
Air
. . O

Although
the
bidding
group
has
n
had
time
to
develop
its
latest
idea
fully
or
to
discuss
it
with
banks
, , O
it
believes
bank
financing
could
be
obtained
. . O

After
the
collapse
of
the
last
effort
, , O
the
group
does
n
plan
to
make
any
formal
proposal
without
binding
commitments
from
banks
covering
the
entire
amount
to
be
borrowed
. . O

Under
the
type
of
transaction
being
discussed
, , O
the
pilot
group
would
borrow
several
billion
dollars
from
banks
that
could
then
be
used
to
finance
a
cash
payment
to
current
holders
. . O

Those
current
holders
would
also
receive
minority
interests
in
the
new
company
. . O

For
example
, , O
the
group
could
offer
$ $ B
200
a
share
in
cash
plus
stock
valued
at
$ $ B
30
a
share
. . O

UAL
currently
has
22
million
shares
, , O
fully
diluted
. . O

The
new
structure
would
be
similar
to
a
recapitalization
in
which
holders
get
a
special
dividend
yet
retain
a
controlling
ownership
interest
. . O

The
difference
is
that
current
holders
would
n
retain
majority
ownership
or
control
. . O

The
failed
takeover
would
have
given
UAL
employees
75
% NN
voting
control
of
the
nation
's
second
airline
, , O
with
management
getting
10
% NN
control
and
British
Air
15
% NN
. . O

It
was
n
clear
how
the
ownership
would
stack
up
under
the
new
plan
, , O
but
employees
would
keep
more
than
50
% NN
. . O

Management
's
total
could
be
reduced
, , O
and
the
public
could
get
more
than
the
15
% NN
control
that
had
been
earmarked
for
British
Air
. . O

One
option
the
board
is
likely
to
consider
today
is
some
sort
of
cooling
period
. . O

Although
the
pilots
are
expected
to
continue
to
pursue
the
bid
, , O
UAL
Chairman
Stephen
Wolf
may
be
asked
to
withdraw
from
the
buy
effort
, , O
at
least
temporarily
, , O
and
to
return
to
running
the
company
full
time
. . O

The
board
could
eventually
come
under
some
pressure
to
sell
the
company
because
its
members
can
be
ousted
by
a
majority
shareholder
vote
, , O
particularly
since
one
of
UAL
stock
is
held
by
takeover
stock
speculators
who
favor
a
sale
. . O

The
labor
buy
group
plans
to
keep
its
offer
on
the
table
in
an
apparent
attempt
to
maintain
its
bargaining
position
with
the
board
. . O

However
, , O
the
only
outsider
who
has
emerged
to
lead
such
a
shareholder
vote
, , O
Los
Angeles
investor
Marvin
Davis
, , O
who
triggered
the
buy
with
a
$ $ I
5
billion
bid
in
early
August
, , O
is
hanging
back
-- : O
apparently
to
avoid
being
blamed
for
contributing
to
the
deal
's
collapse
. . O

Three
top
advisers
to
Mr
Davis
visited
New
York
late
last
week
, , O
at
least
in
part
to
confer
with
executives
at
Citicorp
. . O

Mr
Davis
had
paid
$ $ B
6
million
for
Citicorp
's
backing
of
his
last
bid
. . O

But
Citicorp
has
lost
some
credibility
because
it
also
led
the
unsuccessful
effort
to
gain
bank
loans
for
the
labor
group
. . O

On
Friday
, , O
British
Air
issued
a
statement
saying
it
`` `` O
does
not
intend
to
participate
in
any
new
deal
for
the
acquisition
of
UAL
in
the
foreseeable
future
. . O
'' '' O

However
, , O
several
people
said
that
British
Air
might
yet
rejoin
the
bidding
group
and
that
the
carrier
made
the
statement
to
answer
questions
from
British
regulators
about
how
it
plans
to
use
proceeds
of
a
securities
offering
previously
earmarked
for
the
UAL
buy
. . O

Also
late
last
week
, , O
UAL
flight
attendants
agreed
to
participate
with
the
pilots
in
crafting
a
revised
offer
. . O

But
the
machinists
union
, , O
whose
opposition
helped
scuttle
the
first
buy
bid
, , O
is
likely
to
favor
a
recapitalization
with
a
friendly
third
investor
. . O

One
advantage
the
buy
group
intends
to
press
with
the
board
is
that
pilots
have
agreed
to
make
$ $ B
200
million
in
annual
cost
concessions
to
help
finance
a
bid
. . O

Speculation
has
also
arisen
that
the
UAL
executive
most
closely
identified
with
the
failure
to
gain
bank
financing
, , O
chief
financial
officer
John
Pope
, , O
may
come
under
pressure
to
resign
. . O

However
, , O
people
familiar
with
the
buy
group
said
Mr
Pope
's
departure
would
weaken
the
airline
's
management
at
a
critical
time
. . O

Despite
the
buy
group
's
failure
to
obtain
financing
, , O
UAL
remains
obligated
to
pay
$ $ B
26
million
in
investment
banking
and
legal
fees
to

In

where

been
the
only
way
to
express
political
criticism
, , O
they
're
not
laughing
about
their
new
leader
Egon
Krenz
. . O

Mr
Krenz
is
such
a
contradictory
figure
that
nobody
has
even
come
up
with
any
good
jokes
about
him
. . O

`` `` O
You
have
to
have
clear
feelings

someone
before
you
can
make
jokes

'' '' O
says

mother
of

who
loves
swapping

barbs
with
her
friends
. . O

`` `` O
With
Krenz
, , O
we
just
do
n
know
what
to
expect

'' '' O

Mr
Krenz
does
n
seem
to
be
the
knee
hardliner
many
initially
thought
he
was
when
the
52
Politburo
member
was
selected
last
week
to
succeed
Erich
Honecker
. . O

But
he
does
n
appear
to
be
ready
to
make
broad
changes
either
. . O

According
to
East
Germany
's
ADN
news
agency
, , O
Mr
Krenz
spoke
to
Soviet
leader
Mikhail
Gorbachev
by
telephone
over
the
weekend
and
acknowledged
East
Germany
could
learn
from
Moscow
's
glasnost
policies
. . O

Already
last
week
, , O
Mr
Krenz
started
overhauling
East
Germany
's
heavily
censored
and
notoriously
boring
news
media
. . O

On
Thursday
, , O
a
day
after
he
took
office
, , O
East
German
television
broke
into
regular
programming
to
launch
a
talk
show
in
which
viewers
call
in
questions
for
a
panel
of
officials
to
answer
. . O

The
regular
nightly
news
program
and
daily
newspapers
are
also
getting
a
visible
injection
of
Soviet
glasnost
. . O

`` `` O
It
was
quite
a
shock
, , O
'' '' O
says
a
43
East
German
shopkeeper
. . O

`` `` O
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
, , O
I
was
n
sure
whether
I
was
listening
to
our
news
or
West
German
television
. . O
'' '' O

Other
changes
, , O
including
easing
restrictions
on
travel
for
East
Germans
, , O
are
expected
. . O

But
whether
such
moves
can
win
back
the
confidence
of
East
Germans
, , O
who
have
taken
to
the
streets
by
the
thousands
in
recent
weeks
to
demand
democratic
changes
, , O
depends
largely
on
whether
they
feel
they
can
trust
Mr
Krenz
. . O

And
that
's
a
problem
. . O

Mr
Krenz
is
not
only
closely
identified
with
his
mentor
, , O
Mr
Honecker
, , O
but
also
blamed
for
ordering
violent
police
action
against
protesters
this
month
and
for
praising
China
for
sending
tanks
against
student
demonstrators
. . O

`` `` O
I
hope
he
grows
with
the
job
, , O
'' '' O
says
Rainer
Eppelmann
, , O
a
Protestant
pastor
in
East
Berlin
. . O

`` `` O
The
most
important
thing
is
that
he
have
a
chance
. . O
'' '' O

Although
Mr
Krenz
is
dedicated
to
East
Germany
's
conservative
vein
of
communism
, , O
there
is
much
about
his
style
that
sets
him
apart
from
his
party
comrades
. . O

Unlike
Mr
Honecker
, , O
who
tended
to
lecture
people
about
socialist
values
, , O
Mr
Krenz
enjoys
asking
questions
. . O

Indeed
, , O
one
of
his
first
actions
as
leader
was
to
visit
a
gritty
machine
factory
on
the
outskirts
of
Berlin
and
wander
among
the
workers
-- : O
a
la
Gorbachev
. . O

He
was
later
shown
on
television
, , O
fielding
questions
. . O

At
one
point
, , O
he
asked
a
worker
whether
he
thought
East
Germans
were
fleeing
the
country
because
of
restrictive
travel
policies
. . O

The
worker
's
tart
reply
: : O
`` `` O
It
's
more
than
just
travel
. . O

People
have
a
sense
the
government
is
ignoring
the
real
problems
in
our
society
. . O
'' '' O

The
exchange
was
all
the
more
remarkable
in
that
authorities
released
television
footage
to
Western
news
agencies
. . O

This
same
tendency
toward
openness
impressed
a
group
of
visiting
U
congressmen
this
spring
. . O

Rather
than
trying
to
`` `` O
lecture
us
, , O
'' '' O
says
one
congressional
aide
who
attended
the
two
meeting
, , O
Mr
Krenz
`` `` O
wanted
to
listen
. . O
'' '' O

Rep
Ronnie
Flippo
-LRB
D
, , O
Ala
-RRB
, , O
one
of
the
members
of
the
delegation
, , O
says
he
was
particularly
impressed
by
Mr
Krenz
's
ready
admission
that
East
Germany
needed
to
change
. . O

`` `` O
He
's
a
very
tough
man
, , O
but
one
who
's
also
open
to
arguments
, , O
'' '' O
adds
an
aide
to
West
German
Chancellor
Helmut
Kohl
. . O

But
there
's
another
side
to
Mr
Krenz
. . O

Born
in
a
Baltic
town
in
an
area
which
is
now
part
of
Poland
, , O
he
has
dedicated
his
life
to
the
party
apparatus
. . O

He
moved
quickly
through
the
ranks
with
the
help
of
his
patron
, , O
Mr
Honecker
, , O
and
emerged
as
the
heir
apparent
. . O

Barbara
Donovan
, , O
an
expert
on
East
Germany
at
Radio
Free
Europe
in
Munich
, , O
says
Mr
Krenz
may
project
a
smooth
image
, , O
but
she
doubts
he
's
a
true
reformer
. . O

Even
if
he
is
, , O
she
adds
, , O
he
appears
to
have
only
limited
room
for
maneuver
within
the
Communist
Party
's
ruling
Politburo
. . O

Against
this
background
, , O
the
new
East
German
leader
must
move
quickly
to
shore
up
his

standing

The
sudden
growth
of
the
opposition
movement
, , B
together
with
the
steady
outflow
of
citizens
escaping
through
Poland
and
Hungary
, , O
has
plunged
the
country
into
its
deepest
political
crisis
since
an
anti
workers
' POS
uprising
in
1953

`` `` O
He
does

have
any

period

'' '' O
says
a
Western
diplomat
based
in
East
Berlin
. . O

`` `` O
But
if
he
's
sharp
and
quick
, , O
he
has
a
chance
. . O
'' '' O

The
diplomat
adds
that
Mr
Krenz
has
several
things
going
for
him
. . O

The
East
German
economy
is
strong
compared
with
other
East
bloc
nations
. . O

And
his
relative
youth
could
help
him
project
a
more
vibrant
image
, , O
contrasting
with
the
perception
of
Mr
Honecker
as
an
out
old
man
. . O

For
average
East
Germans
, , O
Mr
Krenz
remains
a
puzzle
. . O

`` `` O
Either
he
was
n
being
real
in
the
past
, , O
or
he
is
n
being
real
right
now
, , O
'' '' O
says
a
30
East
German
doctor
. . O

`` `` O
Either
way
, , O
I
have
a
problem
with
how
quickly
he
's
changed
. . O
'' '' O

The
doctor
was
among
dozens
of
people
milling
through
East
Berlin
's
Gethsemane
Church
Saturday
morning
. . O

The
walls
of
the
church
are
covered
with
leaflets
, , O
news
clippings
, , O
and
handwritten
notes
associated
with
the
country
's
political
opposition

`` `` O
I
have
to
come
here
to

'' '' O
says
the
doctor
, , O
`` `` O
because
it
's
information
I
still
ca
n
get

the
newspapers

'' '' O

Meanwhile
, , O
East
Germany
's
growing
openness
may
even
allow
the
state
news
media
to
display
a
muted
sense
of
humor
. . O

Television
last
week
carried
a
new
report
on
East
Berlin
's
main
wallpaper
factory
and
the
need
to
boost
production
. . O

East
Germans
remember
a
comment
a
few
years
ago
by
Kurt
Hager
, , O
the
government
's
top
ideologist
, , O
that
just
because
a
neighbor
hangs
new
wallpaper
, , O
there
's
no
reason
to
change
your
own
. . O

His
point
was
there
is
no
reason
for
East
Germany
to
copy
Soviet
changes
. . O

`` `` O
It
's
hard
to
know
whether
it
was
intended
to
be
funny
, , O
'' '' O
says
the
East
Berlin
shopkeeper
, , O
`` `` O
But
everyone
I
know
laughed
about
it
. . O

The
list
of
laboratories
claiming
to
be
producing
inexplicable
amounts
of
heat
from
`` `` B
cold
fusion
'' '' I
experiments
is
slowly
growing
. . O

But
the
experiments
continue
to
be
plagued
by
lack
of
firm
evidence
that
the
extra
heat
is
coming
from
the
fusing
of
hydrogen
atoms
. . O

New
experiments
at
some
of
the
big
national
laboratories
are
still
unable
to
find
hints
of
nuclear
fusion
reactions
, , O
leaving
only
the
finding
of
tritium
in
a
Texas
experiment
to
support
University
of
Utah
chemists
' POS
claim
of
achieving
hydrogen
fusion
at
room
temperatures
. . O

The
latest
developments
in
cold
fusion
research
were
presented
in
24
reports
delivered
at
the
fall
meeting
here
of
the
Electrochemical
Society
, , O
the
first
scientific
meeting
in
five
months
to
hear
formal
reports
on
cold
fusion
experiments
. . O

The
meeting
offered
stark
evidence
of
a
dramatic
fall
in
scientific
interest
in
cold
fusion
research
. . O

Of
the
1
chemists
registered
for
the
society
's
weeklong
meeting
, , O
fewer
than
200
sat
through
the
day
and
a
half
of
cold
fusion
presentations
at
week
's
end
. . O

This
was
in
contrast
with
the
society
's
meeting
last
May
, , O
at
the
height
of
the
controversy
, , O
when
more
than
1
scientists
, , O
along
with
scores
of
reporters
and
TV
crews
, , O
crowded
into
a
Los
Angeles
hotel
ballroom
for
a
tumultuous
special
night
session
on
the
subject
. . O

Neither
of
the
two
chemists
whose
Utah
experiments
triggered
the
cold
fusion
uproar
, , O
Martin
Fleischmann
and
B
Stanley
Pons
, , O
were
at
the
meeting
. . O

But
some
members
of
an
ad
hoc
expert
committee
set
up
by
the
Department
of
Energy
to
evaluate
the
cold
fusion
research
were
in
the
audience
. . O

The
committee
is
to
recommend
at
the
end
of
the
month
whether
DOE
should
support
cold
fusion
research
. . O

Most
of
the
two
dozen
scientists
taking
the
podium
reported
results
with
new
, , I
more
sophisticated
variations
of
the
seemingly
simple
electrolysis
experiments
described
last
March
by
Messrs
Fleischmann
and
Pons
. . O

The
experiments
involve
encircling
a
thin
rod
of
palladium
metal
with
a
wire
of
platinum
and
plunging
the
two
electrodes
into
`` `` B
heavy
'' '' I
water
in
which
the
hydrogen
atoms
are
a
doubly
heavy
form
known
as
deuterium
. . O

When
an
electric
current
is
applied
to
the
palladium
and
platinum
electrodes
, , O
the
heavy
water
did
begin
to
break
up
, , O
or
dissociate
. . O

Ordinarily
the
electrolysis
, , I
or
breakup
, , O
of
the
water
would
consume
almost
all
of
the
electrical
energy
. . O

But
Messrs
Fleischmann
and
Pons
said
their
experiments
also
produced
large
amounts
of
heat
. . O

The
heat
energy
plus
the
energy
consumed
by
the
breakup
of
the
water
molecules
added
to
far
more
energy
coming
out
of
the
apparatus
than
electrical
energy
going
in
, , O
they
reported
. . O

Because
they
also
detected
tritium
and
indications
of
nuclear
radiation
, , O
they
asserted
that
the
`` `` I
excess
'' '' I
heat
energy
must
be
coming
from
energy
released
by
the
nuclear
fusion
of
deuterium
atoms
inside
the
palladium
rod
. . O

As
of
last
weekend
, , O
a
dozen
labs
also
have
reported
measuring
`` `` B
excess
'' '' I
heat
from
similar
electrolytic
experiments
, , O
although
amounts
of
such
heat
vary
widely
. . O

One
of
the
seven
reports
presented
here
of
excess
heat
production
was
given
by
Richard
A
Oriani
, , O
professor
of
chemical
engineering
at
the
University
of
Minnesota
. . O

Mr
Oriani
said
his
skepticism
of
the
Utah
claims
was
initially
confirmed
when
his
first
experiments
last
spring
failed
to
produce
results
. . O

But
he
then
borrowed
a
palladium
rod
from
chemists
at
Texas
A
who
said
they
were
getting
excess
heat
. . O

`` `` O
The
results
were
fascinating
, , O
'' '' O
he
said
. . O

On
the
fourth
`` `` I
run
'' '' O
with
the
borrowed
rod
, , O
the
experiment
began
producing
excess
heat
. . O

The
experiment
was
stopped
briefly
to
change
an
instrument
. . O

When
it
was
restarted
, , O
heat
output
`` `` O
really
took
off
'' '' O
and
produced
excess
heat
for
several
hours
before
dying
down
, , O
he
said
. . O

Typical
of
other
experiments
, , O
Mr
Oriani
said
his
experiment
was
`` `` O
very
erratic
. . O
'' '' O

It
would
go
along
doing
nothing
but
dissociating
the
heavy
water
and
then
at
totally
unpredictable
times
, , O
it
would
begin
producing
excess
heat
for
as
long
as
10
or
11
hours
before
quieting
down
. . O

The
excess
heat
was
15
% NN
to
20
% NN
more
than
the
energy
involved
in
the
electrolysis
of
water
. . O

Mr
Oriani
said
the
heat
bursts
were
too
large
and
too
long
to
be
explained
by
the
sudden
release
of
energy
that
might
have
slowly
accumulated
during
the
experiments
' POS
quiescent
times
, , O
as
some
scientists
have
suggested
. . O

`` `` O
There
is
a
reality
to
the
excess
energy
, , O
'' '' O
he
said
. . O

Other
scientists
said
they
also
were
getting
sporadic
bursts
of
excess
heat
lasting
several
hours
at
a
time
. . O

The
bursts
often
occur
, , O
they
said
, , O
after
they
`` `` B
perturbed
'' '' O
the
experiments
by
raising
or
lowering
the
amount
of
electric
current
being
applied
, , O
or
switching
the
current
off
and
on
. . O

One
chemist
privately
suggested
this
hinted
that
some
`` `` I
anomalous
'' '' I
chemical
reactions
might
be
producing
the
heat
. . O

One
reason
questions
surround
the
heat
experiments
is
that
they
involve
unusually
meticulous
measurements
. . O

Typically
, , O
the
input
energy
ranges
from
a
third
of
a
watt
to
one
watt
and
the
excess
energy
is
measured
in
tenths
of
a
watt
. . O

One
exception
is
a
continuing
experiment
at
Stanford
University
where
as
much
as
10
watts
of
energy
are
being
put
into
the
electrolytic
cells
. . O

A
cell
filled
with
heavy
water
is
producing
1
to
1
watts
more
heat
than
an
identical
electrolytic
cell
filled
with
ordinary
water
next
to
it
, , O
reported
Turgut
M
Gur
, , O
an
associate
of
materials
scientist
Robert
A
Huggins
, , O
head
of
the
Stanford
experimental
team
. . O

One
of
the
few
hints
the
excess
heat
might
be
produced
by
fusion
came
from
brief
remarks
by
chemist
John
Bockris
of
Texas
A
University
. . O

Mr
Bockris
previously
reported
getting
bursts
of
excess
heat
and
of
detecting
increasing
amounts
of
tritium
forming
in
the
heavy
water
. . O

He
said
that
within
the
past
few
days
, , O
he
's
gotten
evidence
that
there
is
a
`` `` I
weak
correlation
'' '' O
between
the
time
the
heat
bursts
occur
and
the
production
of
tritium
. . O

There
is
n
any
way
to
continuously
measure
the
amount
of
tritium
in
the
heavy
water
, , O
so
it
's
been
difficult
to
tell
whether
the
tritium
formation
is
related
to
the
heat
bursts
or
some
other
phenomenon
. . O

Increasingly
careful
attempts
to
measure
neutrons
, , O
which
would
be
strong
evidence
of
fusion
reactions
, , O
continue
to
be
negative
. . O

Messrs
Fleischmann
and
Pons
initially
reported
indirect
evidence
of
neutrons
being
produced
in
their
experiment
but
later
conceded
the
measurements
were
questionable
. . O

Researchers
at
Sandia
National
Laboratories
in
Albuquerque
, , O
N
, , O
reported
they
went
so
far
as
to
take
a
`` `` I
cold
fusion
'' '' I
experiment
and
three
neutron
detectors
into
a
tunnel
under
300
feet
of
granite
to
shield
the
detectors
from
cosmic
rays
. . O

A
number
of
times
they
detected
neutrons
in
one
, , B
sometimes
two
, , O
of
the
three
detectors
, , O
but
only
once
during
411
hours
of
the
experiment
did
they
detect
a
neutron
burst
in
all
three
detectors
-- : O
and
they
think
that
was
a
spurious
event
. . O

Shimson
Gottesfeld
of
Los
Alamos
National
Laboratory
said
researchers
there
detected
a
burst
of
neutrons
from
an
early
cold
fusion
experiment
last
April
but
decided
not
to
announce
it
until
they
could
confirm
it
. . O

In
subsequent
experiments
, , O
one
of
two
neutron
detectors
occasionally
indicated
a
burst
of
neutrons
but
neutron
bursts
were
never
recorded
in
both
detectors
at
the
same
time
. . O

They
concluded
the
indications
of
neutrons
stemmed
from
faults
in
the
detectors
rather
than
from
the
cold
fusion
experiment
. . O

At
the
Lawrence
Berkeley
Laboratory
in
California
, , O
new
experiments
indicated
that
the
lithium
added
to
the
heavy
water
so
it
will
conduct
a
current

produce
previously
unsuspected
electrical
effects
on
the
surface
of
the
palladium
rod

which
Messrs
Fleischmann
and
Pons
might
have
misinterpreted

Nelson
Bunker
Hunt
's
attempted
corner
on
silver
a
decade
ago
is
still
haunting
the
market
in

metal

Silver

now
trading

surged
to
an

peak

50

`` `` O
Mr

attempt

squeeze
the
silver
market
10

still
indirectly
to

depression

Lesley
Edgar

managing
director
of

While
some
100
million
ounces
of
silver
once
held
by
Mr
Hunt
and
Middle
Eastern
associates
are
n
hanging
over
the
market
anymore
, , O
the
price
surge
of
1979
precipitated
an
expansion
of
mine
production
and
scrap
recovery
and
encouraged
silver
consumers
to
economize
on
silver
use
, , O
Mr
Edgar
says
. . O

Photographic
developers
, , O
for
example
, , O
bought
equipment
to
recover
silver
from
spent
photographs
, , I
negatives
and
processing
solutions
. . O

Meanwhile
, , O
the
photographic
industry
, , O
which
accounts
for
44
% NN
of
silver
consumption
, , O
continues
to
look
for
substitutes
. . O

Japanese
and
U
photographic
firms
are
beginning
to
produce
electronic
cameras
and
X
that
do
n
require
silver
, , O
dealers
say
. . O

Silver
's
history
of
volatility
is
also
discouraging
investors
, , O
dealers
say
. . O

Even
in
the
present
uncertain
investment
climate
, , O
investors
are
preferring
`` `` O
quality
assets
'' '' O
such
as
Treasury
bills
and
bonds
to
gold
, , I
silver
and
platinum
, , O
dealers
say

Although
prices
rallied
briefly
following
the
tumble
on
world
stock
markets
earlier
this
month
and
the
related
decline
of
the
dollar
, , O
precious
metals
are
out
of
favor
for
the
moment
because
of
high
interest
rates
and
a
determination
by
industrial
nations
to
curb
inflation
, , O
dealers
say
. . O

Silver
, , O
however
is
in
a
deeper
slump
than
are
gold
and
platinum
. . O

Some
analysts
contend
that
silver
is
cheap
now
that
prices
are
languishing
at
levels
last
seen
in
the
mid
. . O

`` `` O
Bargain
hunters
believe
that
silver
offers
the
best
value
amongst
precious
metals
, , O
'' '' O
says
Frederick
R
Demler
, , O
analyst
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc
. . O

A
further
decline
in
prices
will
lead
to
mine
production
cuts
in
the
U
, , O
he
says
. . O

Scrap
merchants
are
converting
smaller
quantities
of
metal
into
silver
, , O
while
low
prices
are
discouraging
exports
from
India
and
the
Soviet
Union
. . O

Silver
prices
could
also
be
boosted
by
strikes
in
leading
producing
nations
Peru
and
Mexico
, , O
Mr
Demler
says
. . O

Meanwhile
, , O
total
fabrication
demand
for
silver
has
risen
six
years
in
a
row
, , O
he
says
. . O

Japanese
demand
grew
by
70
% NN
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
and
the
nation
plans
an
issue
of
a
silver
commemorative
coin
that
will
require
4
million
ounces
. . O

Compared
with
huge
annual
surpluses
of
more
than
100
million
ounces
in
the
first
half
of
the
1980s
, , O
world
silver
supplies
and
consumption
are
now
nearly
in

, , O
Mr
Demler
says

Despite
intermittent
rallies
in
the
past
few
years

improvements
in
the
supply
balance
have

managed

push
silver
prices

`` `` O
There

says

This

the
Commodity
Exchange
of

jumped
`` `` O
by

`` `` O
Silver

Moreover

while

hoard

silver
does

have
the

Investors
have
gotten
burned

more
partial
to

says

Seiler

Yet

Looking

: : O

Livestock
and
Meats

Analysts
expect
the
prices
of
live
cattle
futures
contracts
to
rise
in
trading
today
in
the
wake
of
a
government
quarterly
census
that
found
fewer
cattle
on
feedlots
. . O

After
the
close
of
trading
Friday
, , O
the
Agriculture
Department
reported
that
feedlots
in
the
13
biggest
ranch
states
held
8
million
cattle
on
Oct
1
, , O
down
6
% NN
from
that
date
a
year
earlier
. . O

Most
analysts
had
expected
the
government
to
report
a
4
% NN
decline
. . O

Feedlots
fatten
young
cattle
for
slaughter
, , O
so
a
decline
signals
a
tightening
supply
of
beef
. . O

The
government
reported
that
the
number
of
young
cattle
placed
on
feedlots
during
the
quarter
dropped
5
% NN
compared
with
the
year
quarter
. . O

Many
industry
analysts
had
been
projecting
a
3
% NN
decline
in
placements
for
the
quarter
. . O

In
the
1988
quarter
, , O
many
farmers
were
forced
to
sell
their
cattle
to
feedlot
operators
because
the
drought
dried
out
the
pasture
on
their
ranches
. . O

The
number
of
cattle
moving
onto
feedlots
in
the
recent
quarter
was
also
lower
because
fattening
cattle
is
less
profitable
. . O

A
shortage
of
young
cattle
has
made
them
more
expensive
for
feedlot
operators
to
buy
. . O

The
Agriculture
Department
also
said
that
the
number
of
fattened
cattle
slaughtered
in
the
quarter
dropped
by
5
% NN
from
the
1988
quarter
, , O
which
was
in
line
with
projections
by
analysts
. . O

Energy

Friday
's
44
price
drop
to
$ $ B
19
in
the
expiring
November
contract
for
West
Texas
Intermediate
crude
may
well
set
the
tone
for
trading
this
week
in
petroleum
futures
on
the
New
York
Mercantile
Exchange
. . O

Most
traders
and
analysts
attributed
the
decline
to
technical
factors
associated
with
the
contract
's
going
off
the
board
. . O

Others
said
that
the
drop
continued
the
downward
correction
that
's
been
due
in
the
petroleum
pits
and
that
such
a
trend
could
well
continue
in
the
next
several
trading
sessions
. . O

Barring
any
petroleum
news
events
, , O
trading
in
the
days
ahead
should
further
test
recent
projections
by
oil
economists
and
other
market
watchers
that
strong
fourth
demand
will
keep
prices
firm

Copper

Copper
prices
fell
sharply
Friday
afternoon
. . O

For
example
, , O
copper
for
December
delivery
settled
4
cents
lower
at
$ $ B
1
a
pound
. . O

Pressure
came
from
several
developments
including
the
settlement
of
two
long
strikes
. . O

On
Friday
, , O
one
analyst
said
, , O
rank
workers
ratified
a
new
labor
agreement
ending
a
three
strike
at
the
Highland
Valley
mine
in
British
Columbia
. . O

In
Mexico
, , O
the
analyst
added
, , O
employees
at
the
Cananea
mine
, , O
who
have
been
out
of
work
since
late
August
when
the
mine
was
declared
bankrupt
by
the
government
, , O
accepted
a
35
% NN
cut
in
the
3
work
force
. . O

The
mine
is
expected
to
return
to
production
in
about
a
week
. . O

On
Friday
, , O
selling
dominated
the
afternoon
`` `` I
curb

session
in
London
, , O
which
takes
place
at
noon
EDT
. . O

The
premium
of
cash
copper
to
the
three
forward
offerings
narrowed
, , O
indicating
weaker
demand
for
cash
copper
. . O

Long
support
for
the
December
contract
was
believed
to
be
at
$ $ B
1
a
pound
. . O

A
technical
analyst
said
there
were
a
number
of
stop
orders
under
that
level
that
were
touched
off
when
the
contract
's
price
fell
below
it
. . O

That
brought
in
considerable
fund
selling
, , O
which
continued
until
the
close
of
trading
. . O

`` `` O
In
general
, , O
it
was
a
bearish
close

'' '' O
said
Ben
Hanauer
, , O
a
copper
trader
at
Rudolph
Wolff

Co
, , O
a
major
commodities
trading
and
brokerage
firm

But
whether
this
price
break
has
implications
for
this

he
said

`` `` O
we
will
know
more
when
the
London
Metal
Exchange
copper
stock
levels
are
released
Monday
morning

'' '' O

Another
analyst
said
he
expected
LME
inventories
to
be
down
by
about
15
tons
when
the
weekly
report
is
issued
. . O

Bernard
Savaiko
, , O
senior
commodities
analyst

said
that
when
traders
saw
the
market
was
n
reacting
positively
to
the
forecasts
of

LME
stocks

they
perceived
a
bearish
sign

He
also
noted
that
the
Japanese
, , O
who
had
been
buying
at
prices
just
above
the

level
, , O
apparently
pulled
back
from

Hewlett
Co
will
announce
today
a
software
program
that
allows
computers
in
a
network
to
speed
up
computing
tasks
by
sending
the
tasks
to
each

. . O

Called
Task
Broker
, , O
the
program
acts
something
like
an
auctioneer
among
a
group
of
computers
wired
together

If
a
machine
has
a
big
computing
task
, , O
Task
Broker
asks
other
computers
in
the
network
for
`` `` O
bids
'' '' O
on
the
job

It
then
determines
which
machine
is
free
to
do
the
task
most
quickly
and
sends
the
task
to
that
machine
. . O

Hewlett
claims
that
the
software
allows
a
network
to
run
three
times
as
many
tasks
as
conventional
networks
and
will
run
each
task
twice
as
fast

he
said

`` `` O

The

divvying
up
those

The
prolonged
price
pressures
are
driving
a
wedge
between
some
franchisers
and
their
franchisees
. . O

Mr
Morrissey
, , O
the
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
franchisee
, , O
notes
that
most
franchise
owners
must
absorb
increases
in
expenses
without
any
cut
in
the
royalties
, , O
or
portion
of
sales
, , O
that
they
must
pay
franchisers

Franchisees
ca
n
be
forced
to
go
along
with

franchiser

discounting

But
once
a
franchisee
agrees
to
a
promotional
program

the
franchiser
can
demand
full
participation

the
very
end

Lew
Rudnick
, , O
a
principal
of
Rudnick

Wolfe
, , O
a
Chicago
law
firm
with

industry
clients

He
says

have
held
that
antitrust
considerations
are
outweighed
in
such

by
the
need

protect

marketing

In

in

stay

Reggie
Jackson
, , O
the
retired
baseball
star

has
found
another
use
for
them

Mr
Jackson
, , O
who
won
the
nickname
`` `` O
Mr
October
'' '' O
for
his
World
Series
exploits
, , O
is
selling
some
of
his
canceled
checks
to
autograph
collectors
through
a
dealer
for
as
much
as
$ $ I
500
each
. . O

Dealers
say
the
budding
trade
in
Mr
Jackson
's
canceled
checks
is
unusual
. . O

`` `` O
I
do
n
know
of
any
living
ballplayer
that

ever
done
it
, , O
'' '' O
says
Jack
Smalling
, , O
a
dealer
in
Ames
, , O
Iowa
, , O
and
a
recognized
expert
in
the
field
of
baseball
autographs

An
initial
batch
of
Mr
Jackson
's
checks
was
on
sale
at
a
baseball
show
held
in
San
Francisco
over
Labor
Day
weekend
. . O

Mr
Jackson
showed
up
at
the
affair
to
sign
autographs
for
a
fee
as
well
. . O

`` `` O
For
someone
who
has
everything

Reggie

a
nice
addition

'' '' O
says
William
Vizas
, , O
owner
of
Bill

Sports
Collectibles
in
Denver
, , O
who
examined
the
checks
at
the
San
Francisco
card
show
. . O

For
years
, , O
the
canceled
checks
of
a
small
number
of
well
baseball
players
have
been
bought
and
sold
. . O

But
these
players
were
dead

`` `` O
Maybe

there

and
awhile
back
there
were
Babe
Ruth
checks

'' '' O
says
Mr
Smalling
. . O

However
, , O
the
thought
of
a
living
player
selling
his
checks
rubs
some
people
the
wrong
way
. . O

`` `` O
Maybe

`` `` O
Who
knows

'' '' O

And
Mr
Smalling
does

believe
they
're
worth
all
that
much

`` `` O

he

Why
Mr

who
could

be
reached
for
comment

has
made
some
of
his

He

`` `` O

`` `` O

And
Mr

probably
has
opened

too

Or
at

he
should
. . O

`` `` O
I
assume

says
Mr

referring

USX
Corp
and
its
Japanese
partner
, , O
Kobe
Steel
Ltd
, , O
agreed
to
form
a
joint
venture
to
build
a
new
plant
to
produce
hot
galvanized
sheet
products
, , O
mainly
for
the
automotive
market
. . O

Terms
were
n
disclosed
for
the
plant
, , O
which
will
have
annual
capacity
of
600
tons
. . O

The
move
by
the
nation
's
largest
steelmaker
follows
a
string
of
earlier
announcements
by
other
major
steel
companies
. . O

Bethlehem
Steel
Corp
, , O
LTV
Corp
and
Armco
Inc
all
have
plans
to
build
additional
lines
for
such
coated
corrosion
steel
. . O

The
surge
in
production
, , O
analysts
say
, , O
raises
questions
about
capacity
outpacing
demand
. . O

They
note
that
most
of
the
new
plants
will
come
on
line
in
1992
, , O
when
the
current
import
trade
restraint
program
ends
, , O
which
could
result
in
more
imports
. . O

`` `` O
There
's
too
much
capacity
, , O
'' '' O
contended
Charles
Bradford
, , O
an
analyst
with
Merrill
Lynch
Capital
Markets
. . O

`` `` O
I
do
n
think
there
's
anyone
not
building
one
. . O
'' '' O

He
does
add
, , O
however
, , O
that
transplanted
Japanese
car
makers
are
boosting
the
levels
of
U
steel
in
their
autos
, , O
instead
of
relying
heavily
on
imported
steel
. . O

That
trend
could
increase
demand
for
hot
galvanized
sheet
. . O

The
hot
galvanized
segment
is
one
of
the
fastest
and
most
profitable
segments
of
the
steel
market
, , O
coveted
by
all
major
integrated
steelmakers
wanting
to
maintain
an
edge
over
smaller
minimills
and
reconstructed
mills
-- : O
those
spun
off
to
employees
. . O

Indeed
, , O
USX
said
it
expects
the
market
for
coated
sheet
steel
to
reach
12
million
tons
annually
by
1992
, , O
compared
with
10
million
tons
shipped
in
1988
. . O

For
the
first
eight
months
of
1989
, , O
analysts
say
shipments
of
hot
galvanized
steel
increased
about
8
% NN
from
a
year
earlier
, , O
while
overall
steel
shipments
were
up
only
2
% NN
. . O

USX
and
Kobe
Steel
hope
to
reach
a
definitive
agreement
establishing
the
50
partnership
by
the
end
of
the
year
, , O
with
construction
tentatively
slated
for
the
spring
of
1990
and
production
by
1992
. . O

USX
already
has
six
lines
in
existing
plants
producing
hot
galvanized
steel
, , O
but
this
marks
the
first
so
greenfield
plant
for
such
production
. . O

Moreover
, , O
it
will
boost
by
50
% NN
USX
's
current
hot
capacity
of
1
tons
. . O

The
company
said
it
does
n
expect
the
new
line
's
capacity
to
adversely
affect
the
company
's
existing
hot
galvanizing
lines
. . O

Steelmakers
have
also
been
adding
capacity
of
so
electrogalvanized
steel
, , O
which
is
another
way
to
make
coated
corrosion
steel
. . O

One
of
the
advantages
of
the
hot
process
is
that
it
allows
the
steel
to
be
covered
with
a
thicker
coat
of
zinc
more
quickly
. . O

ONCE
YOU
MAKE
UP
your
mind
about
an
investment
, , O
the
rest
is
easy
, , O
right
? . O

You
just
call
your
broker
and
say
`` `` O
buy
'' '' I
or
`` `` I
sell
. . O
'' '' O

Dream
on
. . O

There
are
all
sorts
of
ways
to
give
buy
and
sell
instructions
to
a
broker
-- : O
and
just
as
many
ways
to
get
burned
if
you
do
n
know
what
you
're
doing
. . O

So
here
's
a
rundown
of
the
most
common
types
of
market
orders
permitted
by
the
stock
and
commodity
exchanges
. . O

Two
things
to
keep
in
mind
: : O
Not
all
exchanges
accept
every
type
of
order
. . O

And
even
when
a
specific
order
is
acceptable
to
an
exchange
, , O
a
brokerage
firm
can
refuse
to
enter
it
for
a
customer
. . O

Market
Order
: : O
This
is
probably
the
most
widely
used
order
-- : O
and
the
one
most
open
to
abuse
by
unscrupulous
floor
brokers
, , O
since
it
imposes
no
price
restrictions
. . O

With
a
market
order
, , O
an
investor
tells
a
broker
to
buy
or
sell
`` `` O
at
the
market
. . O
'' '' O

It
's
like
saying
, , O
`` `` O
get
me
in
now
'' '' O
or
`` `` O
get
me
out
now
. . O
'' '' O

For
example
, , O
if
wheat
is
being
offered
at
$ $ B
4
and
bid
at
$ $ B
4
, , O
a
market
order
to
buy
would
be
filled
at
the
higher
price
and
a
market
order
to
sell
at
the
lower
price
. . O

A
recent
indictment
alleges
that
some
floor
brokers
at
the
two
largest
Chicago
commodity
exchanges
used
market
orders
to
fill
customers
' POS
orders
at
unfavorable
prices
by
arranging
trades
with
fellow
brokers
. . O

Profits
realized
from
these
trades
would
then
be
shared
by
the
conspiring
brokers
. . O

Limit
Order
: : O
Limit
orders
are
used
when
investors
want
to
restrict
the
amount
they
will
receive
or
pay
for
an
investment
. . O

Investors
do
this
by
specifying
a
minimum
price
at
which
the
investment
may
be
sold
or
the
maximum
price
that
may
be
paid
for
it
. . O

Suppose
an
investor
wants
to
sell
a
stock
, , O
but
not
for
less
than
$ $ I
55
. . O

A
limit
order
to
sell
could
be
entered
at
that
price
. . O

One
risk
: : O
Investors
may
regret
the
restriction
if
the
stock
reaches
54
and
then
falls
. . O

Unless
the
market
goes
at
least
one
tick
-LRB
the
smallest
price
increment
permitted
-RRB
beyond
the
limit
price
, , O
investors
are
n
assured
of
having
their
orders
filled
because
there
may
not
be
sufficient
trading
volume
to
permit
filling
it
at
the
specified
price
. . O

Stop
Order
: : O
Stop
orders
tell
a
floor
broker
to
buy
or
sell
an
investment
once
the
price
reaches
a
certain
level
. . O

Once
the
price
reaches
that
level
, , O
a
stop
order
turns
into
a
market
order
, , O
and
the
order
is
filled
at
whatever
price
the
broker
can
get
. . O

Stop
orders
are
sometimes
called
`` `` B
stop
'' '' I
orders
because
they
are
frequently
used
to
protect
profits
or
limit
losses
. . O

While
stop
orders
sound
similar
to
limit
orders
, , O
there
is
a
difference
: : O
Sell
stops
must
be
entered
at
a
price
below
the
current
market
price
and
buy
stops
above
. . O

In
contrast
, , O
sell
limit
orders
must
be
placed
above
the
market
price
and
buy
limit
orders
are
placed
below
. . O

The
crash
in
October
1987
and
last
Friday
's
sell
painfully
taught
some
investors
exactly
what
stop
orders
will
and
wo
n
do
. . O

An
investor
who
may
have
placed
a
stop
order
at
$ $ B
90
under
a
stock
that
was
trading
at
$ $ B
100
a
share
on
the
Friday
before
the
crash
was
stunned
to
discover
that
the
order
was
filled
at
$ $ B
75
when
the
stock
opened
at
that
price
on
Monday
. . O

Stop
Order
: : O
Stop
orders
turn
into
limit
orders
when
an
investment
trades
at
the
price
specified
in
the
order
. . O

Unlike
stop
orders
-- : O
which
are
filled
at
the
market
price
when
the
stop
price
is
hit
-- : O
stop
orders
demand
that
the
trades
be
made
only
at
the
specified
price
. . O

If
it
ca
n
be
made
at
that
price
, , O
it
does
n
get
filled
. . O

Investors
who
wish
to
be
out
of
a
position
, , O
without
the
risk
of
receiving
a
worse
price

Market
Order
: : O
Market
orders
are
like
stop
orders

that
they
become
market
orders
if
a
specified
price
is
reached

However

order

a
buy
market
order

while
a
sell
market
order
is
entered
at

price
above
it

As

Fill
Order
: : O
The
fill
order
is
one
of
several
associated

the
timing

trades

It
instructs
a
broker
to
buy

sell
an
investment
at

almost
exclusively
when

`` `` O

Not
Order
: : O
This
is
another
timing
order

It
is
a
market
order
that
allows
floor
brokers
to
take
more
time
to
buy
or
sell
an
investment
, , O
if
they
think
they
can
get
a
better
price
by
waiting

Not
orders
, , O
which
are
also
known
as
`` `` O
disregard

tape

orders

are
always
done
at

One
Order
: : O
This
is
really
two
orders
in
one
, , O
generally
for
the

security

commodity

instructing
floor
brokers
to
fill
whichever
order
they
can
first
and
then
cancel
the

In
a
fast
market

it

getting
stuck

Specific
Order
: : O
This
type
of
order
couples
many
of
the
orders
described
above
with
instructions
that
the
order
must
be
carried
out
at
or
by
a
certain
time
. . O

`` `` O
On
the
close
'' '' O
can
be
added
to
many
types
of
orders
. . O

For
example
, , O
`` `` O
market
orders
'' '' O
must
be
filled
during
the
last
few
minutes
of
trading
for
the
day
at
a
price
that
is
within
the
official
closing
range
of
prices
as
determined
by
the
exchange

`` `` O
Stop
orders
'' '' O
are
stop
orders
that
only
become
active
during

closing
minutes

`` `` O
Day
orders
'' '' O
expire
at
the
end
of
the
day
on
which
they
are
entered
, , O
`` `` O
good
orders
'' '' O
have
no
expiration
date

Most
brokers
assume
that
all
orders
are
day
orders
unless
specified
otherwise

On
Oct
19
, , I
1987
, , O
some
investors
learned
the
consequences
of
entering
`` `` O
good
limit
orders
'' '' O
and
then
forgetting
about
them

They
found
they
had
bought
stock
from
limit
orders
that
they
might
have
entered
weeks
or
months
earlier
and
had
forgotten
to
cancel

It
is
always
the
responsibility
of
investors
to
keep
track
of
the
orders
they
have
placed

Investors
who
change
their
mind
about
buying
or
selling
after
an
order
has
been
filled
are
, , O
usually

stuck
with
the
consequences

IN
SIZING
UP
the
risks
of
stock
investments
, , O
there
's
probably
no
starting
place
better
than
`` `` O
beta
. . O
'' '' O

But
investors
better
not
ignore
its
limitations
, , O
either
. . O

Beta
is
a
handy
gauge
that
measures
the
volatility
of
a
stock
or
stock
mutual
fund
. . O

For
any
given
move
in
the
overall
market
, , O
it
suggests
how
steeply
that
particular
issue
might
rise
or
fall
. . O

Beta
figures
are
widely
available
and
easy
to
interpret
. . O

The
beta
of
the
broad
market
, , O
typically
defined
as
the
Standard
& CC
Poor
's
500
index
, , O
is
always
1
. . O

So
a
stock
with
a
beta
of
0
is
half
as
volatile
, , O
one
at
1
is
50
% NN
more
volatile
, , O
and
so
on
. . O

Cautious
investors
should
generally
go
with
stocks
that
have
low
betas
. . O

Go
with
high
stocks
to
get
the
biggest
payoff
from
a
bet
on
a
bull
market
. . O

Remember
, , O
though
, , O
that
beta
also
has
important
limitations
. . O

`` `` O
Beta
is
only
part
of
the
risk
in
a
stock
, , O
'' '' O
says
William
F
Sharpe
, , O
the
Stanford
University
emeritus
professor
who
developed
the
measure
. . O

`` `` O
There
is
risk
that
is
not
associated
with
market
moves
, , O
and
the
beta
does
n
tell
you
the
magnitude
of
that
. . O
'' '' O

In
particular
, , O
beta
does
n
measure
the
company
- : O
and
industry
risk
associated
with
an
individual
stock
. . O

That
`` `` I
business
'' '' I
risk
is
very
significant
for
an
investor
with
only
a
few
stocks
, , O
but
it
virtually
disappears
in
a
large
and
well
portfolio
. . O

Beta
is
also
a
poor
indicator
of
the
risk
in
stock
groups
that
march
to
their
own
drummer
. . O

In
particular
, , O
the
prices
of
gold
and
other
precious
stocks
shoot
up
and
down
, , O
but
the
stocks
tend
to
have
low
betas
because
their
moves
are
not
market
. . O

Concern
that
investors
could
misinterpret
such
readings
led
the
American
Association
of
Individual
Investors
to
eliminate
beta
figures
for
precious
funds
in
the
1989
edition
of
its
mutual
guide
. . O

`` `` O
Our
fear
was
people
would
look
just
at
the
beta
-LCB
of
a
gold
fund
-RCB
and
say
here
is
an
investment
with
very
low
risk
, , O
'' '' O
says
John
Markese
, , O
director
of
research
for
the
Chicago
group
. . O

`` `` O
In
reality
it
's
very
volatile
, , O
but
the
movements
are
not
because
of
market
movements

READY
TO
REVIEW
the
riskiness
of
your
investment
portfolio
? . O

First
, , O
a
pop
quiz
. . O

When
you
think
of
the
words
`` `` I
risk
'' '' I
and
`` `` I
investment
, , O
'' '' O
what
's
the
specific
peril
that
comes
to
mind
? . O

Pencils
down
. . O

If
you
're
like
most
people
, , O
you
said
it
's
a
holding
that
goes
completely
sour
-- : B
maybe
a
bond
that
defaults
or
a
stock
whose
value
disappears
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
. . O

`` `` O
People
tend
to
see
risk
primarily
on
that
one
dimension
, , O
'' '' O
says
Timothy
Kochis
, , O
national
director
of
personal
financial
planning
for
accountants
Deloitte
, , I
Haskins
& CC
Sells
. . O

But
therein
lies
another
aspect
of
investment
risk
: : O
the
hazard
of
shaping
your
portfolio
to
avoid
one
or
more
types
of
risk
and
being
blind
by
others
. . O

This
is
clearly
not
good
news
to
all
you
people
who
sleep
like
babies
every
night
, , O
lulled
by
visions
of
your
money
sitting
risk
in
six
CDs
. . O

Risk
wears
many
disguises
, , O
and
investments
that
are
low
in
one
type
of
obvious
risk
can
be
distressingly
high
in
other
, , I
less
obvious
kinds
. . O

U
Treasury
bonds
, , O
for
example
, , O
are
supersafe
when
it
comes
to
returning
money
at
maturity
. . O

But
their
value
as
investments
can
be
decimated
by
inflation
, , O
which
erodes
the
purchasing
power
of
bonds
' POS
fixed
interest
payments
. . O

Risk
is
also
a
function
of
time
. . O

When
financial
professionals
measure
risk
mathematically
, , O
they
usually
focus
on
the
volatility
of
short
returns
. . O

Stocks
are
much
riskier
than
Treasury
bills
, , O
for
example
, , O
because
the
range
in
performance
from
the
best
years
to
the
worst
is
much
wider
. . O

That
is
usually
measured
by
the
standard
deviation
, , O
or
divergence
, , O
of
annual
results
from
the
average
return
over
time
. . O

But
investors
who
are
preoccupied
with
short
fluctuations
may
be
paying
too
little
attention
to
another
big
risk
-- : O
not
generating
enough
money
to
meet
long
financial
and
life
goals
. . O

For
instance
, , O
some
investors
have
sworn
off
stocks
since
the
1987
market
crash
; : O
last
Friday
's
debacle
only
reinforced
those
feelings
. . O

But
the
stock
market
, , O
despite
some
stomach
declines
, , O
has
far
outperformed
other
securities
over
extended
periods
. . O

By
retreating
to
the
apparent
security
of
, , O
say
, , O
money
funds
, , O
investors
may
not
be
earning
enough
investment
return
to
pay
for
a
comfortable
retirement
. . O

`` `` O
That
's
the
biggest
risk
of
all
-- : O
the
risk
of
not
meeting
your
objectives
, , O
'' '' O
says
Steven
B
Enright
, , O
a
New
York
financial
planner
with
Seidman
Financial
Services
. . O

As
a
result
, , O
financial
advisers
say
they
take
several
steps
when
evaluating
the
riskiness
of
clients
' POS
portfolios
. . O

They
estimate
the
return
a
person
's
current
portfolio
is
likely
to
generate
over
time
, , O
along
with
a
standard
deviation
that
suggests
how
much
the
return
will
vary
year
by
year
. . O

They
try
to
figure
out
the
long
results
the
person
needs
to
meet
major
goals
. . O

And
they
eyeball
types
of
risk
that
are
not
easily
quantified
. . O

The
portfolios
of
two
hypothetical
families
, , O
one
a
couple
at
retirement
age
and
another
a
two
couple
at
age
45
, , O
illustrate
several
types
of
risk
that
investors
need
to
consider
. . O

For
instance
, , O
the
insured
municipal
bonds
that
dominate
the
older
couple
's
portfolio
were
probably
selected
in
large
part
for
their
low
repayment
risk
. . O

But
they
expose
the
holders
to
a
lot
of
inflation
risk
and
interest
risk
. . O

The
younger
couple
's
stockholdings
involve
more
risk
than
a
diversified
stock
portfolio
because
the
bulk
of
the
money
is
in
a
single
issue
. . O

Note
that
the
younger
couple
's
portfolio
has
a
higher
expected
annual
return
, , O
10
% NN
vs
8
% NN
, , O
as
calculated
by
Seidman
Financial
Services
, , O
which
is
the
financial
affiliate
of
BDO
Seidman
. . O

That
largely
reflects
the
heavy
stockholdings
. . O

But
one
price
paid
for
the
higher
expected
return
is
greater
short
volatility
, , O
as
reflected
in
the
higher
standard
deviation
that
Seidman
estimates
for
the
younger
couple
's
portfolio
. . O

-LRB
Here
's
how
to
interpret
a
standard
deviation
figure
: : O
Take
the
expected
return
and
add
one
standard
deviation
to
it
. . O

Then
take
the
expected
return
and
subtract
one
standard
deviation
. . O

In
two
of
three
years
, , O
the
actual
result
should
fall
within
that
range
if
all
the
assumptions
were
accurate
. . O

Then
add
and
subtract
two
standard
deviations
to
get
a
wider
range
. . O

There
's
a
95
% NN
probability
any
year
's
result
will
fall
in
the
range
. . O
-RRB

Of
course
, , O
the
greater
volatility
of
the
younger
couple
's
portfolio
does
n
necessarily
mean
those
investments
are
riskier
in
terms
of
meeting
the
holders
' POS
long
goals
. . O

Indeed
, , O
the
older
couple
's
portfolio
could
actually
be
riskier
in
that
sense
if
the
expected
return
wo
n
generate
enough
dollars
to
meet
their
spending
plans
. . O

`` `` O
They
may
feel
emotionally
secure

H
Cammack

When
it
comes
to
investing
, , O
trying
to
weigh
risk
and
reward
can
seem
like
throwing
darts
blindfolded
: : O
Investors
do
n
know
the
actual
returns
that
securities
will
deliver
, , O
or
the
ups
and
downs
that
will
occur
along
the
way
. . O

Looking
to
the
past
can
provide
some
clues
. . O

Over
several
decades
, , O
for
instance
, , O
investors
who
put
up
with
the
stock
market
's
gyrations
earned
returns
far
in
excess
of
those
on
bonds
and
`` `` B
cash
'' '' I
investments
like
Treasury
bills
. . O

But
while
history
can
suggest
what
is
reasonable
to
expect
there
's
no
guarantee
that
the
past
will
repeat
itself
. . O

For
instance
, , O
some
analysts
believe
bond
returns
and
volatility
have
moved
permanently
closer
to
those
of
the
stock
market
. . O

And
returns
on
cash
investments
may
continue
to
exceed
inflation
by
a
wider
margin
than
they
did
over
the
long
past

A

us
today
for
implying

he
had

on
Manuel

He
correctly
says
he
has
been
down
on
Noriega
for
some
time

hence
his
criticism
of
administration
mishandling
of
the
attempted
coup
. . O

Our
October
12
editorial
should
have
been
more
precise
. . O

It
meant
to
convey
our
hope
that
the
Senator
and
other
members
of
the
congressional
left
are
broadening
their
dislike
of
Noriega
to
include
other
notorious
Central

Sandinistas
of

basis
of
his
losing
vote
Tuesday
against

aid
for
the
Nicaraguan
opposition

Senator
Kerry
makes
clear
he
has
not
made
that
intellectual
leap

We
were
wrong

THROUGHOUT
THE
1980s
, , O
investors
have
been
looking
for
creative
alternatives
to
traditional
modes
of
financial
planning
. . O

Capital
has
been
democratized
, , O
and
people
want
in
. . O

Too
often
, , O
however
, , O
small
investors
are
left
with
the
same
stale
solutions
that
appealed
to
previous
generations
of
fiduciary
strategists
. . O

Now
a
startling
new
approach
is
available
to
building
your
financial
portfolio
without
undue
risk
, , O
without
extensive
planning
and
without
hurting
your
life
style
one
bit

This
is

good

who
hate

who
are
incapable

doing
extensive

who
refuse

tinkered

Oil
properties
suffered
a
huge
decline
until
I
divested
myself
of
all
such
stocks
in
1985
, , O
at
which
point
the
industry
, , O
while
not
lighting
up
any
Christmas
trees
, , O
began
a
slow
recovery
. . O

Likewise
, , O
mutual
funds
remained
relatively
flat
until
I
made
what
was
, , O
for
me
, , O
a
serious
investment
. . O

By
1987
, , O
these
properties
were
in
a
tailspin
, , O
causing
my
broker
at
Pru
to
remark
that
she
'd
`` `` O
never
seen
anything
like
it
. . O
'' '' O

Concerned
for
her
state
of
mind
, , O
I
dropped
them
-- : O
and
the
market
instantly
began
its
steady
climb
back
to
health
. . O

Perhaps
most
dramatic
was
the
performance
of
the
metropolitan
New
York
real
market
, , O
which
was
booming
until
I
entered
it
in
late
1988
, , O
at
which
time
it
posted
the
first
negative
compound
annual
growth
rate
in
years
. . O

Disgusted
, , O
I
cast
around
for
a
different
way
to
plan
my
asset
distribution
, , O
and
with
hardly
any
heavy
breathing
the
answer
struck
me
: : O
I
was
doing
it
already
! . O

We
've
all
got
money
to
spend
, , O
some
of
it
clearly
disposable
since
we
keep
disposing
of
it
. . O

Bank
it
? . O

Not
really
! . O

Sock
it
away
in
long
instruments
? . O

Nonsense
! . O

Daily
living
is
the
best
possible
investment
! . O

Your
priorities
may
be
different
, , O
but
here
in
Figure
2
is
where
I
've
chosen
to
build
for
the
future
: : O
personal
space
; : O
automotive
pursuits
; : O
children
's
toys
; : O
gardening
equipment
, , O
bulbs
and
shrubs
; : O
and
finally
, , O
entertainment
, , O
perhaps
the
best
investment
of
all
. . O

All
have
paid
off
for
me
in
double
annual
growth
and
continue
to
provide
significant
potential
. . O

At
least
, , O
according
to
my
calculations
. . O

Personal
space
-LRB
Figure

-RRB
has
grown
35
% NN
annually
over
the
course
of
the
decade
, , O
a
performance
that
would
compare
positively
with
an
investment
in
, , O
say
, , O
synthetic
products
for
the
interiors
of
cold
vehicles
, , O
which
my
cousin
got
into
and
sort
of
regrets
to
this
day
. . O

The
assortment
of
expensive
children
's
toys
that
I
have
purchased
wisely
at
a
host
of
discount
brokerage
firms
-LRB
Figure

-RRB
has
increased
handsomely
in
total
asset
value
far
beyond
any
personal
investment
except
, , O
perhaps
, , O
for
my
record
collection
, , O
whose
worth
, , O
I
think
it
's
safe
to
say
, , O
is
incalculable
. . O

Continued
investment
in
my
1984
subcompact
has
been
part
of
my
strategy
-LRB
Figure

-RRB
, , O
with
present
annual
contributions
now
equaling
more
than
60
% NN
of
the
car
's
original
value
. . O

According
to
my
calculations
, , O
these
outlays
should
have
brought
the
value
of
my
sedan
to
more
than
$ $ I
22
on
the
open
market
-LRB
Figure

-RRB
, , O
where
I
plan
to
offer
it
shortly
. . O

Expansion
of
my
living
space
has
produced
an
obvious
need
for
maintenance
and
construction
of
suitable
lawns
, , I
shrubs
and
bushes
fitting
to
its
suburban
locale
. . O

I
have
thus
committed
sufficient
personal
outlay
to
ensure
that
my
grounds
and
lodgings
will
never
be
short
of
greens
and
flowers
. . O

My
initial
stake
in
this
blooming
enterprise
has
grown
tenfold
, , O
according
to
my
conservative
calculations
. . O

At
the
same
time
, , O
my
share
in
a
wide
variety
of
entertainment
pursuits
has
given
perhaps
the
most
dramatic
demonstration
of
the
benefits
of
creative
personal
financial
planning
. . O

Over
the
course
of
the
decade
, , O
for
instance
, , O
my
return
on
investment
in
the
area
of
poker
alone
-LRB
Figures
7A
and
7B
-RRB
has
been
most
impressive
, , O
showing
bodacious
annual
expansion
with
-- : O
given
the
way
my
associates
play
-- : O
no
sign
of
abatement
into
the
1990s
and
beyond
. . O

With
this
personal
strategy
firmly
in
place
, , O
I
look
forward
to
years
of
fine
life
investments
and
increasing
widespread
leverage
. . O

My
kids
' POS
college
education
looms
as
perhaps
the
greatest
future
opportunity
for
spending
, , O
although
I
'll
probably
have
to
cash
in
their
toy
portfolio
to
take
advantage
of
it
. . O

But
with
every
step
I
take
, , O
I
'm
building
wealth
. . O

You
can
, , O
too
, , O
if
you
, , O
like
me
, , O
refuse
to
bite
the
bullet
. . O

So
go
out
there
and
eat
that
debt
. . O

You
're
right
there
in
the
mainstream
of
American
business
, , O
building
value
on
the
back
of
insupportable
expenditures
. . O

Henry
Kravis
, , O
watch
out
! . O

Mr
Schwartz
is
a
business
executive
and
writer
in
New
York
. . O

WHEN
JAMES
SCHWARTZ
was
just
a
lad
his
father
gave
him
a
piece
of
career
advice
. . O

`` `` O
He
told
me
to
choose
an
area
where
just
by
being
mediocre
I
could
be
great
, , O
'' '' O
recalls
Mr
Schwartz
, , O
now
40
. . O

He
tried
management
consulting
, , O
traded
in
turquoise
for
a
while
, , O
and
even
managed
professional
wrestlers
. . O

Now
he
has
settled
into
a
career
that
fits
the
bill
-- : O
financial
planning
. . O

It
should
be
noted
that
Mr
Schwartz
, , O
who
operates
out
of
Englewood
, , O
Colo
, , O
is
a
puckish
sort
who
likes
to
give
his
colleagues
the
needle
. . O

But
in
this
case
the
needle
has
a
very
sharp
point
. . O

Though
it
's
probably
safe
to
assume
that
the
majority
of
financial
planners
are
honest
and
even
reasonably
competent
, , O
the
fact
remains
that
, , O
as
one
wag
puts
it
, , O
`` `` O
anybody
who
can
fog
a
mirror
'' '' O
can
call
himself
a
financial
planner
. . O

Planners
now
influence
the
investment
of
several
hundred
billion
dollars
, , O
but
in
effect
they
operate
in
the
dark
. . O

There
is
no
effective
regulation
of
planners
, , O
no
accepted
standard
for
admission
into
their
ranks
-- : O
a
dog
got
into
one
trade
group
-- : O
no
way
to
assess
their
performance
, , O
no
way
even
to
know
how
many
of
them
there
are
-LRB
estimates
range
from
60
to
450
-RRB
. . O

All
anyone
need
do
is
hang
up
a
shingle
and
start
planning
. . O

So
it
should
come
as
no
shock
that
the
profession
, , O
if
that
's
what
it
is
, , O
has
attracted
a
lot
of
people
whose
principal
talents
seem
to
be
frittering
away
or
flat
stealing
their
clients
' POS
money
. . O

Alarmed
, , O
state
and
federal
authorities
are
trying
to
devise
ways
to
certify
and
regulate
planners
. . O

Industry
groups
and
reputable
planners
who
are
members
of
them
want
comprehensive
standards
, , O
too
; : O
they
're
tired
of
seeing
practitioners
depicted
collectively
in
the
business
press
as
dumber
than
chimpanzees
and
greedier
than
a
herd
of
swine
. . O

But
reform
has
n
taken
hold
yet
. . O

`` `` O
The
industry
is
still
pretty
much
in
its
Wild
West
days
, , O
'' '' O
says
Scott
Stapf
, , O
director
of
investor
education
for
the
North
American
Securities
Administrators
Association
. . O

An
admittedly
limited
survey
by
NASAA
, , O
whose
members
are
state
securities
regulators
, , O
found
that
between
1986
and
1988
`` `` O
fraud
and
abuse
'' '' O
by
financial
planners
cost
22
investors
$ $ B
400
million
. . O

The
rogues
' POS
gallery
of
planners
involved
includes
some
convicted
felons
, , O
a
compulsive
gambler
or
two
, , O
various
businessmen
who
had
planned
their
own
previous
ventures
right
into
bankruptcy
, , O
and
one
man
who
scammed
his
wife
's
grandmother
. . O

What
's
more
, , O
the
losses
they
and
the
others
caused
`` `` O
are
just
what
we
are
stumbling
over
, , O
'' '' O
says
Mr
Stapf
, , O
adding
that
the
majority
of
misdeeds
probably
go
undetected
. . O

So
do
just
about
all
the
losses
that
could
be
attributed
to
the
sheer
incompetence
of
unqualified
planners
. . O

Nobody
can
estimate
the
toll
, , O
but
John
Gargan
, , O
a
Tampa
, , I
Fla
, , I
planner
and
head
of
one
trade
group
, , O
the
International
Association
of
Registered
Financial
Planners
, , O
thinks
the
danger
to
investors
from
incompetence
is
`` `` O
humongous
, , O
'' '' O
far
greater
than
that
from
crookery
. . O

His
group
, , O
like
others
, , O
wants
minimum
standards
applied
to
all
who
call
themselves
financial
planners
. . O

Surveying
all
this
, , O
some
people
now
think
the
best
planner
might
be
no
planner
at
all
. . O

For
most
investors
`` `` O
the
benefits
just
are
n
worth
the
risks
, , O
'' '' O
says
Barbara
Roper
, , O
who
follows
financial
issues
for
the
Consumer
Federation
of
America
, , O
a
consumer
organization
based
in
Washington
. . O

She
concedes
that
such
a
position
is
`` `` B
unfair
'' '' O
to
the
thousands
of
conscientious
and
qualified
people
plying
the
trade
, , O
but
as
a
consumer
advocate
she
feels
impelled
to
take
it
. . O

She
says
her
group
used
to
give
tips
on
selecting
planners
-- : O
check
educational
and
experience
credentials
, , O
consult
regulators
and
Better
Business
Bureaus
-- : O
but
found
that
even
some
people
who
took
these
steps
`` `` O
were
still
getting
ripped
off
. . O
'' '' O

The
bad
news
, , O
however
, , O
has
n
been
bad
enough
to
kill
the
growing
demand
for
financial
planning
. . O

The
Tax
Reform
Act
of
1986
, , O
which
eliminated
many
tax
shelters
peddled
by
planners
, , O
and
the
stock
market
crash
the
next
year
did
cause
a
sharp
slump
in
such
demand
, , O
and
many
planners
had
to
make
an
unplanned
exit
from
the
business
. . O

But
membership
in
the
International
Association
of
Financial
Planners
-LRB
IAFP
-RRB
, , O
the
industry
's
biggest
trade
group
, , O
is
still
nearly
triple
what
it
was
in
1980
, , O
and
it
's
believed
that
the
ranks
of
planners
who
do
n
belong
to
any
group
have
soared
as
well
. . O

An
estimated
10
million
Americans
are
now
using
financial
planners
, , O
and
the
pool
of
capital
they
influence
is
enormous
. . O

A
survey
of
54
of
them
conducted
by
the
IAFP
in
April
showed
that
these
practitioners
alone
had
controlled
or
guided
the
investment
of
$ $ B
154
billion
of
their
clients
' POS
money
in
the
previous
12
months
. . O

The
sheer
number
of
planners
makes
the
business
extremely
difficult
, , O
if
not
impossible
, , O
to
regulate
. . O

Even
the
minority
of
them
who
must
register
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
as
`` `` O
investment
advisers
'' '' O
-- : O
people
who
are
in
the
business
of
counseling
others
on
the
buying
and
selling
of
securities
specifically
-- : O
have
been
enough
to
swamp
the
agency
's
capacity
. . O

The
SEC
has
only
about
200
staffers
assigned
to
keep
tabs
on
investment
advisers
-- : O
about
the
same
as
in
1980
-- : O
even
though
the
number
of
advisers
has
tripled
to
about
15
over
the
past
decade
. . O

Currently
, , O
a
registered
investment
adviser
can
expect
an
SEC
audit
only
once
every
12
years
. . O

A
lot
of
bad
things
can
happen
in
12
years
. . O

`` `` O
It
does
n
take
a
rocket
scientist
to
figure
out
our
problem
, , O
'' '' O
says
Kathryn
McGrath
, , O
director
of
the
SEC
's
division
of
investment
management
. . O

So
the
SEC
has
proposed
to
Congress
that
much
of
the
job
of
oversight
be
turned
over
to
an
industry
, , I
self
organization
patterned
on
the
National
Association
of
Securities
Dealers
, , O
which
operates
in
the
brokerage
business
. . O

Such
an
organization
could
, , O
among
other
things
, , O
set
minimum
standards
for
competence
, , I
ethics
and
finances
and
punish
those
investment
advisers
who
broke
the
rules
. . O

The
proposal
has
set
off
a
lively
debate
within
an
industry
that
was
far
from
united
to
begin
with
. . O

Mr
Schwartz
, , O
the
puckish
planner
from
Englewood
, , O
Colo
, , O
says
that
allowing
the
business
to
police
itself
would
be
`` `` O
like
putting
Dracula
in
charge
of
the
blood
bank
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Gargan
, , O
the
Tampa
planner
who
heads
one
trade
group
, , O
favors
simply
assessing
the
industry
and
giving
the
money
to
the
SEC
to
hire
more
staff
. . O

-LRB
Mr
Gargan
's
views
are
not
greeted
with
wild
enthusiasm
over
at
the
IAFP
, , O
the
major
industry
organization
. . O

When
the
IAFP
recently
assembled
other
industry
groups
to
discuss
common
standards
that
might
be
applied
to
planners
, , O
Mr
Gargan
's
group
was
excluded
. . O

That
may
be
because
Mr
Gargan
, , O
smarting
at
what
he
considered
slurs
on
his
membership
standards
made
by
the
rival
group
, , O
enrolled
his
dog
, , O
Beauregard
, , O
as
a
member
of
the
IAFP
. . O

Then
he
sent
the
pooch

with
the
certificate
of

it
was
made
out
to
`` `` O
Boris
` `` I
Bo
' '' I
Regaard
'' '' O
-- : O
to
every
newspaper
he
could
think
of
. . O
-RRB

The
states
have
their
own
ideas
about
regulation
and
certification
. . O

NASAA
, , O
the
organization
of
state
securities
regulators
, , O
is
pushing
for
a
model
regulatory
statute
already
adopted
in
eight
states
. . O

It
requires
financial
planners
to
register
with
states
, , O
pass
competency
tests
and
reveal
to
customers
any
conflicts
of
interest
. . O

The
most
common
conflict
involves
compensation
. . O

NASAA
estimates
that
nearly
90
% NN
of
planners
receive
some
or
all
of
their
income
from
sales
commissions
on
securities
, , O
insurance
and
other
financial
products
they
recommend
. . O

The
issue
: : O
Is
the
planner
putting
his
clients
into
the
best
investments
, , O
or
the
ones
that
garner
the
biggest
commissions
? . O

In
1986
the
New
York
attorney
general
's
office
got
an
order
from
a
state
court
in
Albany
shutting
down
First
Meridian
Corp
, , O
an
Albany
financial
firm
that
had
invested
$ $ B
55
million
on
behalf
of
nearly
1
investors
. . O

In
its
notice
of
action
, , O
the
attorney
general
said
the
company
had
promised
to
put
clients
into
`` `` B
balanced
'' '' I
investment
portfolios
; : O
instead
, , O
the
attorney
general
alleged
, , O
the
company
consistently
shoved
unwary
customers
into
high
investments
in
paintings
, , O
coins
and
Florida
condos
. . O

Those
investments
paid
big
commissions
to
First
Meridian
, , O
payments
investors
were
never
told
about
, , O
the
attorney
general
alleged
. . O

Investors
were
further
assured
that
only
those
with
a
minimun
net
worth
would
be
accepted
. . O

In
practice
, , O
the
attorney
general
alleged
in
an
affidavit
, , O
if
an
investor
had
access
to
cash
`` `` O
the
chances
of
being
turned
down
by
First
Meridian
were
about
as
probable
as
being
rejected
by
the
Book
Club

'' '' O

And
, , O
the
attorney
general
added
, , O
First
Meridian
's
president
, , O
Roger
V
Sala
, , O
portrayed
himself
as
a
`` `` I
financial
expert
'' '' O
when
his
qualifications
largely
consisted
of
a
high
diploma
, , O
work
as
a
real

salesman

and
a
stint
as
supervisor
at
a
highway
toll
booth

First
Meridian
and
its
officials
are
currently
under
investigation
for
possible
criminal
wrongdoing

according
to
a

for
the

Mr

`` `` O

Civil
suits
against
planners
by
clients
seeking
recovery
of
funds
are
increasingly
common

Two
such
actions
, , O
both
filed
earlier
this
year
in
Georgia
state
court
in
Atlanta
, , O
could
be
particularly
embarrassing
to
the
industry
: : O
both
name
J
Chandler
Peterson
, , O
an
Atlanta
financial
planner
who
is
a
founder
and
past
chairman
of
the
IAFP
, , O
as
defendant
. . O

One
suit
, , O
filed
by
more
than
three
dozen
investors
, , O
charges
that
Mr
Peterson
misused
much
of
the
$ $ I
9
million
put
into
a
limited
partnership
that
he
operated
and
promoted
, , O
spending
some
of
it
to
pay
his
own
legal
bills
and
to
invest
in
other
companies
in
which
he
had
an
interest
. . O

Those
companies
, , O
in
turn
, , O
paid
Mr
Peterson
commissions
and
fees
, , O
the
suit
alleges
. . O

The
other
suit
was
filed
by
two
men
in
a
dispute
over
$ $ B
100
investments
each
says
he
made
with
Mr
Peterson
as
part
of
an
effort
to
purchase
the
Bank
of
Scottsdale
in
Scottsdale
, , O
Ariz
. . O

One
plaintiff
, , O
a
doctor
, , O
testified
in
an
affidavit
that
he
also
gave
Mr
Peterson
$ $ B
50
to
join
a
sort
of
investment
club
which
essentially
gave
the
physician
`` `` O
the
privilege
of
making
additional
investments
'' '' O
with
Mr
Peterson
. . O

In
affidavits
, , O
each
plaintiff
claims
Mr
Peterson
promised
the
bank
purchase
would
be
completed
by
the
end
of
1988
or
the
money
returned
. . O

Mr
Peterson
took
the
plaintiffs
' POS
and
other
investors
' POS
money
to
a
meeting
of
the
bank
's
directors
. . O

Wearing
a
business
suit
and
western
hat
and
boots
, , O
he
opened
up
his
briefcase
and
dumped
$ $ B
1
million
in
cash
on
a
table
in
front
of
the
directors
, , O
says
Myron
Diebel
, , O
the
bank
's
president

`` `` O
He
said
he
wanted

show
the
color

'' '' O
recalls
Mr
Diebel

Bank
officials
, , O
however
, , O
showed
him
the
door
, , O
and
the
sale
never
came
off
. . O

According
to
the
suit
, , O
Mr
Peterson
has
yet
to
return
the
plaintiffs
' POS
investment
. . O

They
want
it
back
. . O

Mr
Peterson
declines
to
comment
on
specific
allegations
in
the
two
suits
, , O
saying
he
prefers
to
save
such
responses
for
court
. . O

But
he
does
say
that
all
of
his
activities
have
been
`` `` O
entirely
proper

'' '' O

On
the
suit
by
the
limited
partners
, , O
he
says
he
is
considering
a
defamation
suit
against
the
plaintiffs
. . O

The
suit
, , O
he
adds
, , O
`` `` O
is
almost
in
the
nature
of
a
vendetta
by
a
handful
of
disgruntled
people

'' '' O

Rearding
the
suit
over
the
bank
bid
, , O
Mr
Peterson
says
it
is
filled
with
`` `` O
inflammatory
language
and
half
truths
. . O
'' '' O

He
declines
to
go
into
specifics
. . O

Mr
Peterson
says
the
suits
against
him
are
less
a
measure
of
his
work
than
they
are
a
`` `` I
sign
of
the
times
'' '' O
in
which
people
generally
are
more
prone
to
sue
. . O

`` `` O
I
do
n
know
anybody
in
the
industry
who
has
n
experienced
litigation
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
. . O

Mr
Peterson
also
says
he
does
n
consider
himself
a
financial
planner
anymore
. . O

He
now
calls
himself
an
`` `` I
investment
banker
. . O
'' '' O

In
many
scams
or
alleged
scams
involving
planners
, , O
it
's
plain
that
only
a
modicum
of
common
sense
on
the
part
of
the
investors
would
have
kept
them
out
of
harm
's
way
. . O

Using
it
, , O
would
n
a
proessional
hesitate
to
pay
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
just
for
a
chance
to
invest
witha
planner
? . O

Other
cases
go
to
show
that
an
old
saw
still
applies
: : O
If
it
sounds
too
good
to
be
true
, , O
it
probably
is
. . O

Certificates
of
deposit
do
n
pay
23
% NN
a
year
, , O
for
example
, , O
but
that
did
n
give
pause
to
clients
of
one
Alabama
planner

Now
they
're
losers
and
he
's
in
jail
in
Mobile
County
. . O

CDs
yielding
40

are
even
more
implausible
-- : O
especially
when
the
issuing
`` `` I

Marshall

drop

This

dubbed

investigators

`` `` I

How
does

living
end
up
as
a
haven
for

Clearly
, , O
the
existence
of
the

lures
the

`` `` I

You
do

hear
much
about
unusual
concentrations

Bay

Buffalo
. . O

Con
men

Newport

fits
the
scam
artists

specifications
perfectly

What
more
could
a
con
man
in
search
of
the
easy
life
ask
for
? . O

Nothing
seems
hard
here

The
breezes
are
soft

the
waves
lap
gently
and
the
palm
trees
sway
lazily

Nightlife
is
plentiful

Moreover
, , O
ostentation
is
appreciated

The
median

`` `` O
That

'' '' O

The
rich
image
of
Newport

also
helps
lend
the
con
artists

operation
an
air
of
respectability

`` `` O
One
reason

that

until

No
wonder
all

big
scams
have
flourished
here
, , O
from
phony
tax
Bible
sales
to
crooked
car
dealers
to
bogus
penny
traders

But
above
all
, , O
this
is
the
national
headquarters
for
boiler
operators
, , O
those
slick
snake
salesmen
who
use
the
telephone
to
extract
money
from
the
gullible
and
the
greedy
and
then
vanish
. . O

Because
only
a
fraction
of
them
are
ever
prosecuted
, , O
nobody
really
knows
how
much
money
bogus
telemarketing
operators
really
harvest

`` `` O

that

is

Mr
McClelland
says

`` `` O
If

Orange
County

And
most
of
the
truly
big
scams
in
Orange
County
seem
to
originate
in
Newport
Beach
or
one
of
the
other
well
communities
that
surround
this
sliver
city
that
hooks
around
a
point
of
land
on
the
California
coast
south
of
Los

In
fact
, , O
sophisticated
big
boiler
scams
are
known
generically
among
law
types
as
`` `` O
Newport
Beach
'' '' B
operations

That
contrasts
with
the
penny
sales
of
things
such
as
pen
sets
and
office
supplies
that
are
known
as
`` `` O
Hollywood
'' '' B
scams

Newport
Beach
telemarketers
concentrate
on
precious
metals
and
oil
deals
that
typically
cost
thousands
of
dollars
a
shot
. . O

The
investors
range
from
elderly
widows
to
affluent
professionals
. . O

In
one
ingenious
recent
example
of
a
Newport
Beach
boiler
room
, , O
prospective
investors
in
Capital
Trust
Inc
were
allegedly
told
that
their
investment
in
precious

was
insured
against
losses
`` `` O
caused
by
employees
due
to
dishonesty

destruction

'' '' O
according
to
an
indictment
handed
up
by
a
federal
grand
jury
in
Los
Angeles
last
month
. . O

Thus
falsely
reassured
, , O
investors
sent
$ $ B
11
million
to
the
Newport
Beach
company
, , O
most
of
which
was
diverted
to
unauthorized
uses

Douglas
Jones

an

`` `` O

Mr

Newport
Beach
operations
differ
from
the
Hollywood
boiler
rooms
in
style
as
well
as
in
dollars
. . O

Traditionally
, , O
boiler
rooms
operate
on
the
cheap
, , O
since
few
, , O
if
any
, , O
customers
ever
visit
their
offices
. . O

Indeed
, , O
the
name
derives
from
the
tendency
among
telemarketing
scammers
to
rent
cheap
basement
space
, , O
near
the
boiler
room
. . O

But
, , O
says
Mr
Katz
, , O
the
U
attorney
, , O
`` `` O
the
interesting
thing
about
Newport

operations
is
that
they
give
themselves
the
indulgence

furnishings

When
we
go
there

it

quite

from
these
Hollywood
places

the
sandwiches

out

The
Newport

indulge

he
took
frequent
junkets

Riepe

To
get
the
necessary
growth
, , O
adds
Murray
Ruffel
, , O
a
marketing
official
at
the
Financial
Programs
mutual
group
, , O
`` `` O
you
need
to
go
to
the
stock
market
. . O
'' '' O

In
other
words
, , O
a
little
volatility
never
hurt
. . O

It
never
hurt
anyone
, , O
that
is
, , O
unless
the
growth
funds
do
n
grow
when
you
need
them
to
. . O

Or
the
zero
bonds
turn
out
not
to
have
been
discounted
deeply
enough
to
pay
your
kid
's
tuition
. . O

That
's
the
dilemma
for
today
's
parent
. . O

Although
many
experts
are
advising
risk
, , O
no
one
has
a
good
answer
for
you
if
the
risk
does
n
pay
off
. . O

Help
may
be
on
the
way
. . O

The
antitrust
division
of
the
Justice
Department
is
investigating
the
oddly
similar
tuition
charges
and
increases
among
the
top
schools
. . O

Fear
of
the
price
police
could
help
cool
things
off
in
the
1990s
. . O

And
then
there
's
always
State
U
. . O

But
parents
' POS
craving
for
a
top
education
for
their
children
is
growing
like
their
taste
for
fancy
wheels
and
vintage
wine
. . O

Belatedly
aware
of
public
concern
, , O
lawmakers
and
financial
middlemen
are
working
overtime
to
create
and
sell
college
savings
and
investment
schemes
. . O

Their
message
, , O
explicit
or
implicit
, , O
is
that
a
good
college
will
cost
so
much
by
whenever
you
want
it
that
the
tried
and
true
wo
n
do
anymore
. . O

Forget
about
Treasury
bills
or
a
money
fund
. . O

The
latest
wave
of
marketing
is
instructive
. . O

Several
outfits
-- : O
including
the
Financial
Programs
, , O
Franklin
, , O
and
T
Rowe
Price
mutual
groups
and
the
Edward
D
Jones
brokerage
house
-- : O
are
advertising
`` `` B
college
planner
'' '' I
tables
and
charts
that
tell
you
how
much
you
need
to
put
aside
regularly
. . O

The
calculations
generally
rely
on
an
after
rate
of
return
of
8
% NN
annually
-- : O
a
rate
historically
obtainable
by
the
individual
in
only
one
place
, , O
the
stock
market
. . O

Most
of
the
mailers
are
free
, , O
but
Denver
Financial
Programs
sells
, , O
for
$ $ B
15
, , O
a
version
customized
to
the
age
of
the
child
and
the
college
of
choice
. . O

The
figures
are
shocking
. . O

To
build
a
nest
egg
that
would
pay
for
Stanford
when
a
current
first
reaches
college
age
, , O
parents
would
need
to
set
aside
$ $ B
773
a
month
-- : O
for
12
years
. . O

They
can
cut
this
to
$ $ B
691
a
month
if
the
investing
keeps
up
through
college
. . O

And
they
can
further
reduce
the
monthly
amount
if
they
start
saving
earlier
-- : O
when
mother
and
child
come
home
from
the
hospital
. . O

Plugging
a
cheaper
college
into
the
formulas
still
does
n
generate
an
installment
most
people
can
live
with
. . O

Using
a
recent
average
private
cost
of
about
$ $ I
12
a
year
, , O
T
Rowe
Price
's
planner
prescribes
$ $ B
450
monthly
if
the
plan
begins
when
the
child
is
six
. . O

Since
the
formula
assumes
an
8
% NN
before
return
in
a
mutual
fund
, , O
there
would
also
be
$ $ B
16
in
taxes
to
pay
over
the
12
years
. . O

Not
everyone
is
so
pessimistic
. . O

`` `` O
People
are
basically
peddling
a
lot
of
fear
, , O
'' '' O
says
Arthur
Hauptman
, , O
a
consultant
to
the
American
Council
on
Education
in
Washington
. . O

He
takes
issue
with
projections
that
do
n
factor
in
students
' POS
own
contribution
, , O
which
reduces
most
parents
' POS
burden
substantially
. . O

Still
, , O
he
says
, , O
`` `` O
it
's
no
bad
thing
'' '' O
if
all
the
marketing
prods
people
into
putting
aside
a
little
more
. . O

`` `` O
The
situation
you
want
to
avoid
is
having
somebody
not
save
anything
and
hope
they
'll
be
able
to
do
it
out
of
current
income
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
. . O

`` `` O
That
's
crazy
. . O
'' '' O

His
advice
: : O
Do
n
panic
. . O

Parents
, , O
he
says
, , O
should
aim
at
whatever
regular
investment
sum
they
can
afford
. . O

Half
the
amount
that
the
investment
tables
suggest
might
be
a
good
goal
, , O
he
adds
. . O

That
way
, , O
parents
will
reduce
borrowings
and
outlays
from
current
income
when
the
time
comes
to
pay
tuition
. . O

Mr
Hauptman
reckons
that
the
best
investment
choice
is
mutual
funds
because
they
are
managed
and
over
time
have
nearly
kept
up
with
the
broad
stock
averages
. . O

He
favors
either
an
all
fund
or
a
balanced
fund
that
mixes
both
stocks
and
bonds
. . O

In
their
anxiety
, , O
however
, , O
parents
and
other
student
benefactors
are
flocking
to
new
schemes
. . O

They
have
laid
out
about
$ $ I
1
billion
for
so
baccalaureate
zero
municipal
bonds
-- : O
so
far
offered
by
Connecticut
, , O
Illinois
, , O
Virginia
and
eight
other
states
. . O

And
they
have
bought
about
$ $ I
500
million
in
prepaid
plans
, , O
offered
in
Michigan
, , I
Florida
and
Wyoming
. . O

The
prepaid
plans
take
payment
today
-- : O
usually
at
current
tuitions
or
at
a
slight
discount
-- : O
for
a
promise
that
tuition
will
be
covered
tomorrow
. . O

The
baccalaureate
bonds
-- : O
tax
, , O
offered
in
small
denominations
and
usually
containing
a
provision
that
they
wo
n
be
called
before
maturity
-- : O
seem
to
be
tailor
for
college
savers
. . O

Like
other
zeros
, , O
they
pay
all
their
interest
at
maturity
, , O
meaning
that
buyers
can
time
things
so
that
their
bonds
pay
off
just
when
Junior
graduates
from
high
school
. . O

Their
compounding
effect
is
also
alluring
. . O

In
June
, , O
Virginia
sold
bonds
for
$ $ B
268
that
will
pay
$ $ B
1
in
2009
. . O

But
Richard
Anderson
, , O
head
of
the
Forum
for
College
Financing
Alternatives
, , O
at
Columbia
University
, , O
a
research
group
partly
financed
by
the
federal
government
, , O
says
zeros
are
particularly
ill
. . O

Their
price
falls
further
than
that
of
other
bonds
when
inflation
and
interest
rates
kick
up
. . O

That
wo
n
matter
if
they
are
held
to
maturity
, , O
but
if
, , O
for
any
reason
, , O
the
parents
need
to
sell
them
before
then
, , O
there
could
be
a
severe
loss
of
principal
. . O

Had
zeros
been
available
in
1972
and
had
parents
bought
a
face
amount
equal
to
four
years
' POS
tuition
at
the
time
, , O
aiming
for
their
children
's
1988
enrollment
, , O
they
would
have
been
left
with
only
enough
to
pay
for
two
years
, , O
Mr
Anderson
figures
. . O

Most
other
bonds
, , O
however
, , O
would
probably
not
have
fared
much
better
. . O

The
prepaid
plans
may
be
a
good
bet
, , O
provided
the
guarantee
of
future
tuition
is
secure
. . O

Issuing
states
generally
limit
the
guarantees
to
in
institutions
, , O
however
, , O
and
buyers
get
refunds
without
much
interest
if
the
children
do
n
attend
the
specified
schools
. . O

Two
private
groups
are
seeking
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
approval
for
plans
that
could
be
more
broadly
transferable
. . O

Mr
Anderson
wants
the
prestige
colleges
to
sponsor
such
a
plan
. . O

The
issue
here
may
be
the
soundness
of
the
guarantee
. . O

Prepayments
, , O
much
like
mutual
purchases
, , O
are
pooled
for
investment
. . O

Sponsors
are
naturally
counting
on
their
ability
to
keep
ahead
of
tuition
inflation
with
investment
returns
. . O

But
buyers
are
essentially
betting
on
a
start
investment
fund
with
no
track
record
-- : O
and
some
have
been
encouraged
to
borrow
to
do
so
. . O

One
problem
is
that
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
has
decided
that
the
investment
earnings
and
gains
of
the
sponsors
' POS
funds
are
taxable
. . O

The
colleges
, , O
as
educational
institutions
, , O
had
hoped
that
would
n
be
the
case
. . O

Based
on
historical
rates
of
return
, , O
Mr
Anderson
reckons
a
100
% NN
stock
portfolio
, , O
indexed
to
the
market
, , O
would
have
kept
up
with
tuition
and
taxes
in
the
20th
century
. . O

But
sponsors
might
not
pick
the
stocks
that
will
match
the
market
. . O

And
they
're
leaning
more
toward
fixed
income
, , O
whose
returns
after
tax
have
trailed
tuition
increases
. . O

`` `` O
I
'm
not
sure
they
're
going
to
make
it
work
, , O
'' '' O
says
Mr
Anderson
. . O

What
happens
if
the
sponsors
do
n
have
the
cash
to
pay
the
tuitions
? . O

Florida
and
Wyoming
have
backed
up
their
guarantees
with
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
state
governments
, , O
meaning
that
taxpayers
will
pick
up
any
slack
. . O

Not
so
Michigan
. . O

Its
plan
is
set
up
as
an
independent
agency
. . O

The
state
says
there
's
no
worry
-- : O
investment
returns
, , O
combined
with
fees
and
the
gains
from
unused
plans
, , O
will
provide
all
the
cash
it
needs
. . O

Mr
Putka
covers
education
from
The
Wall
Street
Journal

Boston
bureau

If
you
start
saving
for
your
child
's
eduction
on
Jan
1
, , I
1990
, , O
here
's
the

sum

will
need

invest

pay

four
years

AMONG
THE
CATFISH
farmers
in
the
watery
delta
land
of
Humphreys
County
, , O
Miss
, , O
Allen
D
Tharp
of
Isola
was
one
of
the
best
known
and
most
enterprising
. . O

He
sold
quarter
fingerlings
to
stock
other
farmers
' POS
ponds
, , O
and
he
bought
back
one
food
that
he
`` `` B
live
'' '' O
to
market
along
with
his
own
whiskery
crop
. . O

And
he
nearly
always
bought
and
sold
for
cash
. . O

Along
the
way
, , O
Mr
Tharp
omitted
a
total
of
$ $ B
1
million
from
his
receipts
reported
on
federal
tax
returns
for
three
years
. . O

The
returns
landed
in
the
hands
of
an
Internal
Revenue
Service
criminal
investigator
, , O
Samuel
James
Baker
. . O

Mr
Baker
interviewed
or
wrote
to
hundreds
of
catfish
farmers
, , O
live
and
processors
throughout
the
South
before
coming
up
with
detailed
estimates
of
purchases
and
sales
, , O
in
pounds
and
dollars
, , O
by
Mr
Tharp
and
others
. . O

Unknown
to
Mr
Tharp
, , O
he
had
fouled
his
net
on
a
special
IRS
project
to
catch
catfish
farmers
and
haulers
inclined
to
cheat
on
their
taxes
. . O

Confronted
with
the
evidence
, , O
Mr
Tharp
pleaded
guilty
to
one
charge
of
filing
a
false
return
and
was
fined
$ $ B
5
and
sentenced
to
18
months
in
prison
. . O

He
also
owes
a
lot
of
back
taxes
, , O
interest
and
civil
fraud
penalties
. . O

A
lot
of
taxpayers
out
there
are
n
as
paranoid
as
one
might
think
. . O

Federal
and
state
tax
enforcers
develop
many
group
targets
for
investigation
, , O
on
the
basis
of
occupation
, , O
high
income
, , O
type
of
income
, , O
or
some
other
characteristic
that
may
signal
an
opportunity
or
tendency
to
hide
income
or
exaggerate
deductions
. . O

Many
professions
long
have
seemed
to
be
targets
because
of
the
exotic
or
ludicrous
efforts
of
some
members
to
offset
high
income
with
fake
losses
from
phony
tax
shelters
: : O
dentists
who
invested
in
dubiously
dubbed
foreign
films
or
airline
pilots
who
raised
racehorses
on
their
days
off
. . O

Mail
ministers
have
been
squelched
. . O

Now
, , O
television
and
radio
evangelists
are
under
scrutiny
. . O

The
IRS
recently
won
part
of
its
long
battle
with
the
Church
of
Scientology
over
exemptions
when
the
U
Supreme
Court
held
that
members
' POS
payments
to
the
church
were
n
deductible
because
the
members
received
services
in
return
. . O

IRS
statistics
show
that
the
more
persistent
hiders
of
income
among
sole
proprietors
of
businesses
include
used
dealers
, , O
entertainment
producers
, , O
masons
, , O
roofers
, , O
and
taxi
owners
. . O

Small
businesses
in
general
account
for
almost
40
% NN
of
unreported
personal
income
, , O
the
IRS
has
said
. . O

Once
such
abuses
become
so
pervasive
, , O
the
IRS
builds
another
factor
into
its
secret
computer
formula
for
selecting
returns
for
audit
and
does
n
need
special
projects
for
them
. . O

San
Franciscans
have
a
much
higher
incidence
of
audits
than
average
because
more
of
them
score
high
under
that
formula
, , O
not
because
IRS
agents
envy
their
life
styles
. . O

Many
openings
for
mass
cheating
, , O
such
as
questionable
tax
shelters
and
home
offices
, , O
have
gaped
so
broadly
that
Congress
has
passed
stringent
laws
to
close
them
. . O

Deductions
of
charitable
gifts
of
highly
valued
art
now
must
be
accompanied
by
appraisals
. . O

And
laws
requiring
the
reporting
of
more
varieties
of
transactions
have
enabled
the
IRS
to
rely
on
computers
to
ferret
out
discrepancies
with
returns
and
to
generate
form
inquiries
to
taxpayers
. . O

Unreported
alimony
income
can
be
spotted
by
computer
because
a
payer
of
alimony
-LRB
who
gets
a
deduction
-RRB
must
report
the
former
spouse
's
Social
Security
number
. . O

Passport
applicants
now
must
give
Social
Security
numbers
, , O
enabling
the
IRS
to
see
whether
Americans
living
abroad
are
filing
required
U
returns
. . O

But
while
IRS
computers
focus
routinely
on
target
groups
like
these
, , O
the
agency
has
assigned
many
agents
to
special
projects
that
need
more
personal
attention
. . O

In
most
cases
, , O
the
IRS
says
, , O
these
projects
are
local
or
regional
, , O
rather
than
national
, , O
and
arise
because
auditors
in
an
area
detect
some
pattern
of
abuse
among
, , O
say
, , O
factory
workers
claiming
that
having
a
multitude
of
dependents
frees
them
from
tax
withholding
or
yacht
owners
deducting
losses
from
sideline
charter
businesses
. . O

The
national
office
currently
has
21
noncriminal
audit
projects
, , O
according
to
Marshall
V
Washburn
, , O
deputy
assistant
commissioner
for
examination
. . O

Auditors
involved
in
noncriminal
projects
ca
n
send
anyone
to
jail
, , O
but
they
can
make
life
miserable
in
other
ways
-- : O
for
one
, , O
by
imposing
some
of
the
150
different
civil
penalties
for
negligence
, , O
failure
to
file
a
return
, , O
and
the
like
. . O

The
targeted
audit
groups
include
direct
sellers
-- : O
people
who
sell
cosmetics
, , O
housewares
and
other
items
door
to
door
or
at
home
parties
-- : O
and
employers
who
label
workers
as
independent
contractors
instead
of
employees
, , O
to
avoid
the
employer
share
of
payroll
taxes
. . O

Other
projects
look
for
offenders
among
waiters
who
get
cash
tips
, , O
people
who
engage
in
large
cash
transactions
, , O
and
people
whose
returns
show
they
sold
a
home
for
a
profit
without
reinvesting
the
capital
gain
in
another
home
by
the
end
of
the
same
year
; : O
the
gain
must
be
rolled
over
within
two
years
to
defer
tax
. . O

And
now
that
returns
must
show
dependents
' POS
Social
Security
numbers
, , O
the
IRS
wants
to
see
which
dependents
show
up
on
more
than
one
return
-- : O
and
which
dependents
turn
out
to
be
deceased
. . O

Impetus
for
the
direct
project
came
from
a
congressional
hearing
some
years
back
. . O

It
prompted
an
IRS
study

travel

costs

The

out
returns

`` `` B

taxpayers
who
report
low
income

large
expenses
from

The
Tax
Court
recently
denied
business
deductions
by
Mr

Mrs
Peter

Rubin
of
Cherry

who
both
were
part
distributors
of
Amway
products
in

to
their
regular
jobs
as
sales
people
in
other
fields

For
1984

they
reported
gross
income
of

from
Amway
sales

offset
by
expenses
totaling

including
car
costs
of

and
travel

The
Tax
Court
did

believe
that
the
Rubins
, , O
who
earned

65

treated
the
sideline
as
a
real

The
Direct
Selling
Association
, , O
a
trade
group

points
out
that
its
members
, , O
which
include
Amway
Corp
, , O
cooperate
with
the
IRS
to
distribute
tax
material
to
sales
people
and
are
helping
to
prepare
a
public
television
program
on
the
subject
. . O

The
independent
project
, , O
which
began
in
1988
, , O
involves
about
350
IRS
agents
. . O

In
the
fiscal
nine
months
ended
June
30
, , O
reports
Raymond
P
Keenan
, , O
assistant
commissioner
for
collection
, , O
they
examined
about
13
employers
, , O
assessed
more
than
$ $ I
67
million
in
delinquent
employment
taxes
, , O
and
reclassified
about
56
workers
as
employees
instead
of
self
contractors
. . O

The
number
of
misclassified
workers
may
be
in
the
millions
, , O
mostly
paid
by
small
firms
. . O

Many
workers
, , B
especially
professionals
, , O
want
to
remain
independent
to
avoid
tax
withholding
and
to
continue
to
deduct
many
expenses
that
employees
ca
n
. . O

But
many
others
, , O
who
want
to
qualify
for
employee
benefits
and
unemployment
compensation
, , O
become
tipsters
for
the
IRS
, , O
says
Jerry
Lackey
, , O
who
manages
the
IRS
project
's
force
of
nine
agents
in
north
and
central
Florida
from
Orlando
. . O

Firms
that
are
paying
employment
taxes
also
provide
leads
to
competitors
that
are
n
, , O
he
says
. . O

In
his
area
, , O
Mr
Lackey
continues
, , O
the
miscreant
employers
most
commonly
are
in
construction
-- : O
doing
framing
, , O
drywall
, , O
masonry
and
similar
work
. . O

But
a
medical
clinic
with
about
20
employees
wrongly
listed
all
of
them
-- : O
including
physicians
and
receptionists
-- : O
as
independent
contractors
. . O

The
IRS
assessed
the
clinic
$ $ B
350
in
back
payroll
taxes
. . O

It
assessed
nearly
$ $ I
500
against
a
cruise
company
that
carried
about
100
deckhands
, , I
cooks
, , I
bartenders
, , I
entertainers
and
other
employees
as
self
independents
. . O

Revenue
states
also
are
becoming
more
aggressive
pursuers
of
tax
delinquents
, , O
and
perhaps
none
tracks
them
down
with
more
relish
than
does
New
York
since
it
acquired
an
$ $ I
80
million
computer
system
in
1985
. . O

The
state
's
tax
enforcers
have
amassed
data
bases
from
other
New
York
agencies
that
license
or
register
professionals
and
businesses
; : O
from
exchange
agreements
with
the
IRS
, , O
24
other
states
, , O
and
two
Canadian
provinces
, , B
and
even
from
phonebook
Yellow
Pages
. . O

Thus
armed
for
massive
matching
of
documents
by
computer
, , O
they
single
out
high
groups
, , O
looking
primarily
for
people
who
have
n
filed
New
York
income
returns
. . O

The
state
has
combed
through
records
relating
to
architects
, , O
stockbrokers
, , O
lawyers
in
the
New
York
City
area
, , O
construction
workers
from
out
of
the
state
, , O
and
homeowners
who
claim
to
be
residents
of
other
states
-- : B
especially
Florida
, , O
which
has
no
personal
income
tax
. . O

Soon
to
feel
the
glare
of
attention
are
lawyers
elsewhere
in
the
state
, , O
doctors
, , O
dentists
, , O
and
accountants
, , O
says
Frederick
G
Hicks
, , O
director
of
the
tax
division
that
develops
the
computer
programs
. . O

The
department
has
collected
over
$ $ I
6
million
from
brokers
so
far
and
recommended
more
than
30
of
them
for
criminal
prosecution
. . O

In
the
early
stage
of
checking
people
with
incomes
exceeding
$ $ B
500
who
were
filing
nonresident
returns
, , O
it
squeezed
$ $ B
7
million
out
of
a
man
who
was
posing
as
a
Florida
resident

`` `` O
We
think
we
can
reclaim
hundreds
of

In
finding
`` `` O
good
news
'' '' O
in
Berkeley
's
new
freshman
admissions
plan
-LRB
`` `` O
The
Privileged
Class
, , O
'' '' O
editorial
, , O
Sept
20
-RRB
, , O
you
're
reading
the
headline
but
not
the
story
. . O

The
plan
indeed
raises
from
40
% NN
to
50
% NN
the
number
of
freshmen
applicants
admitted
strictly
by
academic
criteria
. . O

But
that
does
n
mean
`` `` O
half
of
the
students
attending
Berkeley
'' '' O
will
be
admitted
this
way
. . O

The
plan
is
talking
about
applicants
admitted
, , B
not
students
who
enroll
. . O

Since
the
`` `` I
yield
'' '' O
from
this
top
slice
of
applicants
is
relatively
low
, , O
boosting
admits
from
40
% NN
to
50
% NN
will
boost
registrants
from
about
31
% NN
to
38
% NN
of
the
class
. . O

In
addition
, , O
perhaps
5
% NN
of
registrants
will
come
from
a
new
category
consisting
of
applicants
whose
academic
credentials
`` `` O
narrowly
missed
'' '' O
gaining
them
admission
in
the
first
category
. . O

But
against
that
combined
increase
of
12
% NN
in
students
chosen
by
academic
criteria
, , O
the
plan
eliminates
a
large
category
in
which
admissions
now
are
based
on
grades
, , O
test
scores
and
`` `` O
supplemental
points
'' '' O
for
factors
such
as
high
curriculum
, , O
English
proficiency
and
an
essay
. . O

This
category
now
accounts
for
about
19
% NN
of
admits
and
22
% NN
of
registrants
. . O

The
plan
thus
will
decrease
by
22
% NN
, , O
for
a
net
loss
of
10
% NN
, , O
the
number
of
students
admitted
primarily
by
academic
criteria
. . O

Who
will
take
over
these
places
? . O

The
plan
creates
a
new
category
of
students
from
`` `` O
socioeconomically
disadvantaged
backgrounds
, , O
'' '' O
a
concept
not
yet
defined
, , O
and
gives
them
about
10
% NN
of
the
class
. . O

One
of
the
plan
's
authors
has
defended
the
`` `` I
socioeconomic
disadvantage
'' '' I
category
as
perhaps
making
more
sense
than
the
current
affirmative
preferences
based
on
race
. . O

Perhaps
it
does
. . O

But
the
new
category
does
not
replace
or
reduce
Berkeley
's
broad
racial
preferences
. . O

Nor
will
students
from
racial
groups
who
are
admitted
through
the
new
category
be
counted
against
the
affirmative
`` `` I
target
'' '' O
for
their
group
. . O

The
plan
thus
places
a
large
new
affirmative
program
, , O
based
on
`` `` O
socioeconomic
disadvantage
, , O
'' '' O
on
top
of
the
existing
program
based
on
race
. . O

The
role
of
academic
criteria
in
choosing
Berkeley
's
freshmen
can
only
decline
as
a
result

THOSE
WHO
DELIGHT
in
the
misfortune
of

This
is
a
story
about
suckers

Most
of
us
know
a
sucker

Many
of
us
are
suckers

But
what
we
may
not
know
is
just
what
makes
somebody
a
sucker

What
makes
people
blurt
out
their
credit
numbers
to
a
caller
they
've
never
heard
of
? . O

Do
they
really
believe
that
the
number
is
just
for
verification
and
is
simply
a
formality
on
the
road
to
being
a
grand
winner

What
makes
a
person
buy
an
oil
well
from
some
stranger
knocking
on
the
screen
door
? . O

Or
an
interest
in
a
retirement
community
in
Nevada
that
will
knock
your
socks
off
, , O
once
it
is
built
? . O

Because
in
the
end
, , O
these
people
always
wind
up
asking
themselves
the
same
question
: : O
`` `` O
How
could
I
be
so
stupid
? . O
'' '' O

There
are
, , O
unfortunately
, , O
plenty
of
answers
to
that
question

artists

all
of
them

John

He

be

`` `` O

a
definite
psychology
of
the
sale
and
different
personalities

pitch
different
ways

'' '' O
he
says

The
most
obvious
pitch
, , O
of
course

is
the
lure
of
big
returns

`` `` O
We

for
the
Securities

Exchange
Commission
in
Miami

`` `` O
These
guys
prey
on
human
frailties

'' '' O

While
the
promises
of
big
profits
ought
to
set
off
warning
bells
, , O
they
often
do
n
, , O
in
part
because
get
tales
have
become
embedded
in
American
folklore

`` `` O
The
overnight

says
Michael

`` `` O

Adds

`` `` O

Clearly

FOX
HUNTING
HAS
been
defined

the
unspeakable
in

the
inedible
, , O
but
at
least
it
's
exercise

At
least
it
has
a
little
dash

Most
of

have
to
spend
our
time
on
pursuits
that
afford
neither
, , O
drab
duties
rather
than
pleasures

Like
trying
to
buy
life
insurance

for
instance
, , O
an
endeavor
notably
lacking
in
dash
. . O

Call
it
the
uninformed
trudging
after
the
incomprehensible
. . O

But
sooner
or
later
, , O
most
of
us
have
to
think
about
life
insurance
, , O
just
as
we
often
have
to
think
about
having
root
work
. . O

And
my
time
has
come
. . O

I
'm
33
, , O
married
, , O
no
children
, , O
and
employed
in
writing
stories
like
this
one
. . O

In

targeted

meaning

a

family

it

So
if
anything
happened
to

, , O
I
'd
want
to
leave
behind
enough
so
that
my
33
husband
would
be
able
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
and
some
other
debts

not
, , O
I
admit

enough
to
put

Figuring
that
maybe
$ $ B
100
to
$ $ I
150
would
do

having
no
idea
of
what
kind
of
policy
I
wanted
, , O
I
looked
at
the
myriad
products
of
a
dozen
companies
-- : O
and
plunged
into
a
jungle
of
gibberish
. . O

Over
the
past
decade
or
two
, , O
while
I
was
thinking
about
fox
hunting
, , O
the
insurance
industry
has
spawned
an
incredible
number
of
products
, , O
variations
on
products
, , O
and
variations
on
the
variations
. . O

Besides
term
life
and
whole
life
-LRB
the
old
standbys
-RRB
, , O
we
now
have
universal
life
, , O
universal
variable
life
, , O
flexible
adjustable
universal
life
, , O
policies
with
persistency
bonuses
, , O
policies
festooned
with
exotic
riders
, , O
living
benefit
policies
, , O
and
on
and
on
. . O

What
to
do
? . O

First
, , O
generalize
. . O

Shorn
of
all
their
riders
, , I
special
provisions
, , I
and
other
bells
and
whistles
, , O
insurance
policies
can
still
be
grouped
under
two
broad
categories
: : O
so
pure
insurance
, , O
which
amasses
no
cash
value
in
the
policy
and
pays
off
only
upon
death
, , O
and
permanent
insurance
, , O
which
provides
not
only
a
death
benefit
but
also
a
cash
value
in
the
policy
that
can
be
used
in
various
ways
while
the
insured
is
still
alive
. . O

If
all
you
want
is
death
coverage
, , O
pure
insurance
-- : O
a
term
policy
-- : O
gives
you
maximum
bang
for
your
buck
, , O
within
limits
. . O

It
's
much
cheaper
than
permanent
insurance
bought
at
the
same
age
. . O

But
`` `` O
term
'' '' O
means
just
that
; : O
the
policy
is
written
for
a
specific
time
period
only
and
must
be
renewed
when
it
expires
. . O

It
may
also
stipulate
that
the
insured
must
pass
another
medical
exam
before
renewal
; : O
if
you
flunk
-- : O
which
means
you
need
insurance
more
than
ever
-- : O
you
may
not
be
able
to
buy
it
. . O

Even
if
you
're
healthy
and
can
renew
, , O
your
premium
will
go
up
sharply
because
you
're
that
much
older
. . O

So
term
insurance
may
not
be
as
cheap
as
it
looks
. . O

There
are
all
sorts
of
variations
on
term
insurance
: : O
policies
structured
to
pay
off
your
mortgage
debt
, , O
term
riders
tacked
on
to
permanent
insurance
, , O
and
many
others
. . O

One
variation
that
appealed
to
me
at
first
was
the
`` `` I
Money
Smart
Term
Life
'' '' I
policy
offered
by
Amex
Life
Insurance
Co
, , O
the
American
Express
unit
, , O
to
the
parent
company
's
credit
holders
. . O

Upon
examination
, , O
however
, , O
I
wondered
whether
the
plan
made
a
lot
of
sense
. . O

Amex
said
it
would
charge
me
$ $ B
576
a
year
for
$ $ B
100
of
coverage
-- : O
and
would
pay
me
back
all
the
premiums
I
put
in
if
I
canceled
the
policy
after
10
years
. . O

Sounds
great
-- : O
or
does
it
? . O

First
, , O
if
I
canceled
, , O
I
'd
have
no
more
insurance
, , O
a
not
insignificant
consideration
. . O

Second
, , O
the
$ $ I
5
I
'd
get
back
would
be
much
diminished
in
purchasing
power
by
10
years
of
inflation
; : O
Amex
, , I
not
I
, , O
would
get
the
benefit
of
the
investment
income
on
my
money
, , O
income
that
would
have
exceeded
the
inflation
rate
and
thus
given
the
company
a
real
profit
. . O

Third
and
most
important
, , O
Amex
would
charge
me
a
far
higher
premium
than
other
reputable
companies
would
on
a
straight
term
policy
for
the
same
amount
; : O
I
'd
be
paying
so
heavily
just
to
have
the
option
of
getting
my
premiums
back
that
I
'd
almost
have
to
cancel
to
make
the
whole
thing
worthwhile
. . O

That
would
be
all
right
with
Amex
, , O
which
could
then
lock
in
its
investment
profit
, , O
but
it
does
n
add
up
to
a
`` `` I
smart
money
'' '' I
move
for
me
. . O

Which
goes
to
show
that
the
First
Law
applies
in
insurance
as
in
anything
else
: : O
There
is
no
free
lunch
, , O
there
is
only
marketing
. . O

And
the
Second
Law
, , O
unique
to
insurance
? . O

If
I
die
early
, , O
I
win
-- : O
a
hollow
victory
, , O
since
I
ca
n
enjoy
it
-- : O
and
if
I
live
long
, , O
the
insurer
wins
. . O

Always
. . O

This
is
worth
remembering
when
insurers
and
their
salesmen
try
to
sell
you
permanent
insurance
, , O
the
kind
that
amasses
cash
value
. . O

The
word
`` `` I
death
'' '' O
can
not
be
escaped
entirely
by
the
industry
, , O
but
salesmen
dodge
it
wherever
possible
or
cloak
it
in
euphemisms
, , O
preferring
to
talk
about
`` `` B
savings
'' '' I
and
`` `` I
investment
'' '' O
instead
. . O

The
implication
is
that
your
permanent
policy
is
really
some
kind
of
CD
or
mutual
account
with
an
added
feature
. . O

That
is
gilding
the
lily
. . O

The
fact
is
that
as
a
savings
or
investment
vehicle
, , O
insurance
generally
runs
a
poor
second
to
any
direct
investment
you
might
make
in
the
same
things
the
insurance
company
is
putting
your
money
into
. . O

That
's
because
you
have
to
pay
for
the
insurance
portion
of
the
policy
and
the
effort
required
to
sell
and
service
the
whole
package
. . O

Again
, , O
no
free
lunch
. . O

This
is
reflected
in
a
built
mortality
cost
-- : O
in
effect
, , O
your
share
of
the
company
's
estimated
liability
in
paying
off
beneficiaries
of
people
who
had
the
effrontery
to
die
while
under
its
protection
. . O

And
in
most
cases
, , O
a
huge
hunk
of
your
premium
in
the
initial
year
or
two
of
the
the
policy
is
, , O
in
effect
, , O
paying
the
salesman
's
commission
as
well
; : O
investment
returns
on
most
policies
are
actually
negative
for
several
years
, , O
largely
because
of
this
. . O

So
view
permanent
insurance
for
what
it
is
-- : O
a
compromise
between
pure
insurance
and
direct
investment
. . O

The
simplest
, , I
most
traditional
form
of
permanent
insurance
is
the
straight
whole
life
policy
. . O

You
pay
a
set
premium
for
a
set
amount
of
coverage
, , O
the
company
invests
that
premium
in
a
portfolio
of
its
choosing
, , O
and
your
cash
value
and
dividends
grow
over
the
years
. . O

One
newer
wrinkle
, , O
so
called
single
life
-LRB
you
pay
for
the
whole
policy
at
once
-RRB
, , O
has
been
immensely
popular
in
recent
years
for
tax
reasons
; : O
the
insured
could
extract
cash
value
in
the
form
of
policy
`` `` I
loans
, , O
'' '' O
and
none
of
the
proceeds
were
taxable
even
though
they
included
gains
on
investment
. . O

Congress
closed
this
loophole
last
year
, , O
or
thought
it
did
. . O

However
, , O
Monarch
Capital
Corp
of
Springfield
, , O
Mass
, , O
has
developed
a
`` `` I
combination
plan
'' '' O
of
annuity
and
insurance
coverage
that
it
says
does
not
violate
the
new
regulations
and
that
allows
policy
loans
without
tax
consequences
. . O

But
the
percentage
of
your
cash
reserve
that
you
can
borrow
tax
is
very
small
. . O

I
'm
not
prepared
in
any
case
to
put
that
much
money
into
a
policy
immediately
, , O
so
I
look
into
the
broad
category
called
universal
life
. . O

Hugely
popular
, , O
it
is
far
more
flexible
than
straight
whole
life
. . O

I
can
adjust
the
amount
of
insurance
I
want
against
the
amount
going
into
investment
; : O
I
can
pay
more
or
less
than
the
so
target
premium
in
a
given
year
; : O
and
I
can
even
skip
payments
if
my
cash
reserves
are
enough
to
cover
the
insurance
portion
of
the
policy
. . O

In
looking
at
these
and
other
policies
, , O
I
learn
to
ask
pointed
questions
about
some
of
the
assumptions
built
into
`` `` O
policy
illustrations
'' '' O
-- : O
the
rows
of
numbers
that
show
me
the
buildup
of
my
cash
values
over
the
years
. . O

They
commonly
give
two
scenarios
: : O
One
is
based
on
interest
rates
that
the
company
guarantees
-LRB
usually
4
% NN
to
4
% NN
-RRB
and
the
other
on
the
rate
it
is
currently
getting
on
investment
, , O
often
8
% NN
or
more
. . O

Projecting
the
latter
over
several
decades
, , O
I
find
my
cash
buildup
is
impressive
-- : O
but
can
any
high
interest
rate
prevail
for
that
long
? . O

Not
likely
, , O
I
think
. . O

Also
, , O
some
policy
illustrations
assume
that
mortality
costs
will
decline
or
that
I
will
get
some
sort
of
dividend
bonus
after
the
10th
year
. . O

These
are
not
certain
, , O
either
. . O

Companies
`` `` O
are
n
comfortable
playing
these
games
, , O
but
they
realize
they
're
under
pressure
to
make
their
policies
look
good
, , O
'' '' O
says
Timothy
Pfiefer
, , O
an
actuarial
consultant
at
Tillinghast
, , O
a
unit
of
Towers
Perrin
Co
, , O
the
big
New
York
consulting
firm
. . O

Another
factor
to
consider
: : O
Some
of
the
companies
currently
earning
very
high
yields
are
doing
so
through
substantial
investment
in
junk
bonds
, , O
and
you
know
how
nervous
the
market
has
been
about
those
lately
. . O

There
are
seemingly
endless
twists
to
universal
life
, , O
and
it
pays
to
ask
questions
about
all
of
them
. . O

At
a
back
barbecue
, , O
for
example
, , O
a
friend
boasts
that
she
'll
only
have
to
pay
premiums
on
her
John
Hancock
policy
for
seven
years
and
that
her
death
benefits
will
then
be
`` `` O
guaranteed
. . O
'' '' O

I
call
her
agent
, , O
David
Dominici
. . O

Yes
, , O
he
says
, , O
premiums
on
such
variable
coverage
can
be
structured
to
`` `` I
vanish
'' '' O
after
a
certain
period
-- : O
but
usually
only
if
interest
rates
stay
high
enough
to
generate
sufficient
cash
to
cover
the
annual
cost
of
insurance
protection
. . O

If
interest
rates
plunge
, , O
the
insurer
may
be
knocking
on
my
door
, , O
asking
for
steeper
premium
payments
to
maintain
the
same
amount
of
protection
. . O

I
do
n
like
the
sound
of
that
. . O

Some
insurers
have
also
started
offering
`` `` O
persistency
bonuses
, , O
'' '' O
such
as
extra
dividends
or
a
marginally
higher
interest
yield
, , O
if
the
policy
is
maintained
for
10
years
. . O

But
Glenn
Daily
, , O
a
New
York
financial
consultant
, , O
warns
that
many
of
these
bonuses
are
`` `` O
just
fantasies
, , O
'' '' O
because
most
are
n
guaranteed
by
the
companies
. . O

And
the
feature
is
so
new
, , O
he
adds
, , O
that
no
insurer
has
yet
established
a
track
record
for
actually
making
such
payments
. . O

So
living
provisions
also
merit
a
close
inspection
. . O

Offered
by
insurers
that
include
Security
Life
Insurance
Co
, , O
Jackson
National
Life
Insurance
Co
, , O
and
National
Travelers
Life
Insurance
Co
, , O
these
policy
riders
let
me
tap
a
portion
of
my
death
benefits
while
I
'm
still
alive
. . O

Some
provisions
would
let
me
collect
a
percentage
of
the
policy
's
face
value
to
pay
for
long
care
such
as
nursing
stays
; : O
others
would
allow
payments
for
catastrophic
illnesses
and
conditions
such
as
cancer
, , O
heart
attarcks
, , O
renal
failure
and
kidney
transplants
. . O

But
the
catastrophic
events
for
which
the
policyholder
can
collect
are
narrowly
defined
, , O
vary
from
policy
to
policy
, , O
and
generally
permit
use
of
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
face
amount
of
insurance
. . O

Also
, , O
financial
planners
advising
on
insurance
say
that
to
their
knowledge
there
has
not
yet
been
a
tax
ruling
exempting
these
advance
payments
from
taxes
. . O

And
considering
the
extra
cost
of
such
provisions
, , O
some
figure
that
people
interested
in
, , O
say
, , O
paying
for
extended
nursing
care
would
be
better
off
just
buying
a
separate
policy
that
provides
it
. . O

I
'm
more
favorably
impressed
by
`` `` O
no
life
, , O
'' '' O
even
though
it
turns
out
to
be
low
life
. . O

Insureres
selling
these
policies
market
them
directly
to
the
public
or
otherwise
do
n
use
commissioned
salesmen
; : O
there
is
still
a
load
-- : O
annual
administrative
fees
and
initial
`` `` I
setup
'' '' I
charges
-- : O
but
I
figure
that
the
lack
of
commission
and
of
`` `` O
surrender
fees
'' '' O
for
dropping
the
policy
early
still
saves
me
a
lot
. . O

I
compared
one
universal
policy
for
$ $ B
130
face
amount
from
such
an
insurer
, , O
American
Life
Insurance
Corp
of
Lincoln
, , O
Neb
, , O
with
a
similar
offering
from
Equitable
Life
Assurance
Society
of
the
U
, , O
which
operates
through
11
commissioned
salesmen
. . O

After
one
year
I
could
walk
away
from
the
Ameritas
policy
with
$ $ B
792
, , O
but
Id
get
only
$ $ I
14
from
the
Equitable
. . O

The
difference
is
magnified
by
time
, , O
too
. . O

At
age
65
, , O
when
I
'd
stop
paying
premiums
, , O
the
Ameritas
offering
would
have
a
projected
cash
value
$ $ B
14
higher
than
the
other
, , O
even
though
the
Equitable
's
policy
illustration
assumed
a
fractionally
higher
interest
rate
. . O

Did
I
buy
it
? . O

Well
, , O
not
yet
. . O

I
'm
thinking
about
using
the
$ $ I
871
annual
premium
to
finance
a
trip
to
Paris
first
. . O

A
person
can
do
some
heavy
thinking
about
insurance
there
-- : O
and
shop
for
something
more
exciting
while
she
's
doing
it

Rorer
Group
Inc
will
report
that
third
profit
rose
more
than
15
% NN
from
a
year
earlier
, , O
though
the
gain
is
wholly
due
to
asset
sales
, , O
Robert
Cawthorn
, , O
chairman
, , O
president
and
chief
executive
officer
, , O
said
. . O

His
projection
indicates
profit
in
the
latest
quarter
of
more
than
$ $ I
17
million
, , O
or
55
cents
a
share
, , O
compared
with
$ $ B
15
million
, , O
or
48
cents
a
share
, , O
a
year
ago
. . O

Mr
Cawthorn
said
in
an
interview
that
sales
will
show
an
increase
from
a
year
ago
of
`` `` O
somewhat
less
than
10
% NN
. . O
'' '' O

Through
the
first
six
months
of
1989
, , O
sales
had
grown
about
12
% NN
from
the
year
period
. . O

Growth
of
10
% NN
would
make
sales
for
the
latest
quarter
$ $ B
269
million
, , O
compared
with
$ $ B
244
million
a
year
ago
. . O

Mr
Cawthorn
said
the
profit
growth
in
the
latest
quarter
was
due
to
the
sale
of
two
Rorer
drugs
. . O

Asilone
, , O
an
antacid
, , O
was
sold
to
Boots
PLC
, , O
London
. . O

Thrombinar
, , O
a
drug
used
to
stanch
bleeding
, , O
was
sold
to
Jones
Medical
Industries
Inc
, , O
St
Louis
. . O

He
said
Rorer
sold
the
drugs
for
`` `` O
nice
prices
'' '' O
and
will
record
a
combined
, , I
pretax
gain
on
the
sales
of
$ $ B
20
million
. . O

As
the
gain
from
the
sales
indicates
, , O
operating
profit
was
`` `` O
significantly
'' '' B
below
the
year
level
, , O
Mr
Cawthorn
said
. . O

Rorer
in
July
had
projected
lower
third
operating
profit
but
higher
profit
for
all
of
1989
. . O

He
said
the
company
is
still
looking
for
`` `` O
a
strong
fourth
quarter
in
all
areas
-- : O
sales
, , O
operating
income
and
net
income
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Cawthorn
attributed
the
decline
in
third
operating
profit
to
the
stronger
dollar
, , O
which
reduces
the
value
of
overseas
profit
when
it
is
translated
into
dollars
; : O
to
accelerated
buying
of
Rorer
products
in
the
second
quarter
because
of
a
then
July
1
price
increase
, , B
and
to
higher
marketing
expenses
for
Rorer
's
Maalox
antacid
, , O
whose
sales
and
market
share
in
the
U
had
slipped
in
the
first
half
of
1989
. . O

He
said
Rorer
opted
to
sell
Asilone
and
Thrombinar
to
raise
revenue
that
would
`` `` I
kick
start
'' '' O
its
increased
marketing
efforts
behind
Maalox
, , O
still
its
top
product
with
about
$ $ I
215
million
in
world
sales
in
1988
. . O

`` `` O
We
had
underfunded
Maalox
for
a
year
, , O
'' '' O
he
said
, , O
because
the
company
was
concentrating
on
research
and
development
and
promoting
other
drugs
. . O

He
said
Rorer
will
spend
$ $ B
15
million
to
$ $ I
20
million
more
on
Maalox
advertising
and
promotion
in
the
second
half
of
1989
than
in
the
year
period
. . O

A
`` `` I
big
chunk
'' '' O
of
that
additional
spending
came
in
the
third
quarter
, , O
he
said
. . O

Hoechst
AG
said
it
will
stop
producing
fertilizer
in
1990
because
of
continued
losses

The
West
German
chemical
concern
said
it
will
close
the
last
remaining
fertilizer
plant
in
Oberhausen
in

fall

Hoechst
said
the

faces
overcapacity

rising

from

It

Blue

The

By

The

programs

traders
buy
stock
against
offsetting

lock
in

differences
-- : O
helped
the
rally
's
momentum
. . O

The
euphoria
was
such
that
investors
responded
to
good
earnings
reports
of
companies
such
as
American
Express
, , O
while
ignoring
the
disappointing
profits
of
companies
such
as
Caterpillar
, , O
analysts
said

Stock
arbitrage
trading

a

traders
said

Institutional

were
the
main
force
pushing

To

One

nobody
seemed
to
mind
the
news
that
British

making
a
special
effort
to
revive
the
UAL

The
announcement
of

's
troubles
triggered
the
market
's
nose
dive
a
week

Takeover
enthusiasm
may
have
been
renewed
when

group
disclosed

required

`` `` O

Peter
VandenBerg

a

But

A

illness

The
study
surveyed
a

medical
directors

personnel

employee
assistance
program
directors
about
their
perceptions

these
problems
in

It
is
one
of

series
of
studies
on
health
commissioned
by
the
New
York
Business
Group
, , O
a
non
organization
with
about
300
members
. . O

The
stress
study
was
undertaken
because
problems
related
to
stress
`` `` O
are
much
more
prevalent
than
they
seem
, , O
'' '' O
said
Leon
J
Warshaw
, , O
executive
director
of
the
business
group
. . O

In
presenting
the
study
late
last
week
, , O
Dr
Warshaw
estimated
the
cost
of
these
types
of
disorders
to
business
is
substantial
. . O

Occupational
disability
related
to
anxiety
, , I
depression
and
stress
costs
about
$ $ I
8
a
case
in
terms
of
worker
's
compensation
. . O

In
terms
of
days
lost
on
the
job
, , O
the
study
estimated
that
each
affected
employee
loses
about
16
work
days
a
year
because
of
stress
, , I
anxiety
or
depression
. . O

He
added
that
the
cost
for
stress
compensation
claims
is
about
twice
the
average
for
all
injury
claims
. . O

`` `` O
We
hope
to
sensitize
employers
'' '' O
to
recognize
the
problems
so
they
can
do
something
about
them
, , O
Dr
Warshaw
said
. . O

Early
intervention
into
these
types
of
problems
can
apparently
save
businesses
long
expense
associated
with
hospitalization
, , O
which
sometimes
results
when
these
problems
go
untreated
for
too
long
. . O

Even
the
courts
are
beginning
to
recognize
the
link
between
jobs
and
stress
disorders
in
compensation
cases
, , O
according
to
a
survey
by
the
National
Council
on
Compensation
Insurance
. . O

But
although
56
% NN
of
the
respondents
in
the
study
indicated
that
mental
problems
were
fairly
pervasive
in
the
workplace
, , O
there
is
still
a
social
stigma
associated
with
people
seeking
help
. . O

The
disorders
, , O
which
20
years
ago
struck
middle
and
older
people
, , O
`` `` O
now
strike
people
at
the
height
of
productivity
, , O
'' '' O
says
Robert
M
Hirschfeld
, , O
of
the
National
Institute
of
Mental
Health
, , O
who
spoke
at
the
presentation
of
the
study
's
findings
. . O

The
poll
showed
that
company
size
had
a
bearing
on
a
manager
's
view
of
the
problem
, , O
with
65
% NN
of
those
in
companies
of
more
than
15
employees
saying
stress
problems
were
`` `` O
fairly
pervasive
'' '' O
and
55
% NN
of
those
in
companies
with
fewer
than
4
employees
agreeing
. . O

The
poll
also
noted
fear
of
a
takeover
as
a
stress
event
in
larger
companies
. . O

More
than
eight
in
10
respondents
reported
such
a
stress
situation
in
their
company
. . O

Mid
companies
were
most
affected
by
talk
of
layoffs
or
plant
closings
. . O

The
study
, , O
which
received
funding
from
Upjohn
Co
, , O
which
makes
several
drugs
to
treat
stress
illnesses
, , O
also
found
47
% NN
of
the
managers
said
stress
, , I
anxiety
and
depression
contribute
to
decreased
production
. . O

Alcohol
and
substance
abuse
as
a
result
of
stress
problems
was
cited
by
30
% NN
of
those
polled
. . O

Although
Dr
Warshaw
points
out
that
stress
and
anxiety
have
their
positive
uses
, , O
`` `` O
stress
perceived
to
be
threatening
implies
a
component
of
fear
and
anxiety
that
may
contribute
to
burnout
. . O
'' '' O

He
also
noted
that
various
work
environments
, , O
such
as
night
work
, , O
have
their
own
`` `` I
stressors

'' '' O

`` `` O

D
, , O
of
Rohrer
, , I
Hibler
& CC
Replogle
, , O
a
corporate
psychology
and
management
consulting
firm

The
problem
, , O
says
Mr
D
, , O
a
psychologist
, , O
is
that
`` `` O
it
's

hard

that
a
90

his

In

earns
only
twice
the
minimum
wage
, , O
largely
due
to
the
earnings
limit

she
would
have
to
earn
an
additional
$ $ I
4
to
offset
her
catastrophic
surtax
of

496
. . O

Eliminating
the
earnings
limit
would
greatly
help
seniors

reduce

Repeal
would
generate
more
in
new
taxes
than
the

lose

now
need

be
held

test
amendment

When
his
Seventh
Avenue
fur
business
here
was
flying
high
20
years
ago
, , O
Jack
Purnick
had
25
workers
and
a
large
factory
. . O

Now
his
half
employees
work
in
an
eighth
shop
that
he
says
is
smaller
than
his
old
storage
room
. . O

He
also
says
he
is
losing
money
now
. . O

He
blames
imports
. . O

But
just
down
Seventh
Avenue
, , O
where
about
75
% NN
of
U
fur
garments
are
made
, , O
Larry
Rosen
has
acquired
two
retail
outlets
, , O
broadened
his
fur
line
and
expanded
into
leather
. . O

He
credits
imports
. . O

The
difference
lies
in
how
the
two
entrepreneurial
furriers
reacted
to
the
foreign
competition
and
transformation
of
their
industry
over
the
past
10
years
. . O

One
stuck
to
old
business
traditions
, , O
while
the
other
embraced
the
change
. . O

`` `` O
The
small
, , I
good
fur
salon
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
, , O
'' '' O
says
Mr
Purnick
, , O
75
years
old
. . O

`` `` O
We
make
the
finest
product
in
the
world
, , O
and
the
Americans
are
being
kicked
around
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Rosen
, , O
though
, , O
believes
imports
have
reinvigorated
the
industry
in
which
he
has
worked
for
most
of
his
57
years
. . O

`` `` O
You
've
got
some
minds
here
that
wo
n
think
progressively
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
. . O

Import
competition
for
U
furs
has
risen
sharply
since
furriers
started
aggressively
marketing
`` `` O
working
mink
'' '' O
and
similar
lower
imported
furs
in
recent
years
. . O

Merchants
discovered
a
consumer
largely
ignored
by
higher
furriers
: : O
the
younger
woman
-- : O
even
in
her
late
20s
-- : O
who
never
thought
she
could
buy
a
mink
. . O

The
new
market
helped
boost
U
fur
sales
to
about
$ $ I
1
billion
a
year
now
, , O
triple
the
level
in
the
late
1970s
. . O

It
also
opened
the
door
to
furs
made
in
South
Korea
, , O
China
, , O
Hong
Kong
and
other
countries
. . O

Jindo
Furs
, , O
a
large
South
Korean
maker
, , O
says
it
operates
35
retail
outlets
in
the
U
and
plans
to
open
15
more
by
the
end
of
next
year
. . O

Mr
Purnick
and
other
old
furriers
call
many
of
the
the
imports
unstylish
and
poorly
made
. . O

High
U
furriers
say
these
imports
have
n
squeezed
them
. . O

But
low
and
middle
furriers
like
Mr
Purnick
, , O
who
once
saturated
the
five
Seventh
Avenue
fur
district
, , O
say
imports
have
cut
their
sales
. . O

A
woman
who
once
would
have
saved
for
two
or
three
seasons
to
buy
a
U
mink
can
now
get
an
imported
mink
right
away
for
less
than
$ $ I
2
. . O

Yet
Mr
Rosen
has
turned
the
import
phenomenon
to
his
advantage
. . O

Early
in
the
decade
he
saw
that
fur
workers
in
many
foreign
countries
were
willing
to
work
longer
hours
at
lower
wages
than
their
American
counterparts
and
were
more
open
to
innovation
. . O

In
1982
, , O
he
started
a
factory
in
Greece
. . O

Two
years
later
, , O
he
opened
one
in
West
Germany
. . O

He
also
noticed
that
foreign
makers
were
introducing
many
variations
on
the
traditional
fur
, , O
and
he
decided
to
follow
suit
. . O

By
combining
his
strengths
in
innovation
and
quality
control
with
the
lower
costs
of
production
abroad
, , O
he
says
he
has
been
able
to
produce
high
goods
at
low
cost
. . O

To
maintain
control
over
production
and
avoid
overdependence
on
foreign
sources
, , O
he
says
he
still
makes
most
of
his
furs
in
the
U
. . O

But
six
years
ago
he
also
began
importing
from
the
Far
East
. . O

Inspired
by
imports
, , O
Mr
Rosen
now
makes
fur
muffs
, , I
hats
and
flings
. . O

This
year
he
produced
a
men
's
line
and
offers
dyed
furs
in
red
, , O
cherry
red
, , O
violet
, , O
royal
blue
and
forest
green
. . O

He
has
leather
jackets
from
Turkey
that
are
lined
with
eel
skin
and
topped
off
with
raccoon
collars
. . O

From
Asia
, , O
he
has
mink
jackets
with
floral
patterns
made
by
using
different
colored
furs
. . O

Next
he
will
be
testing
pictured
embroidery
-LRB
called
kalega
-RRB
made
in
the
Far
East
. . O

He
plans
to
attach
the
embroidery
to
the
backs
of
mink
coats
and
jackets
. . O

Besides
adding
to
sales
, , O
leathers
also
attract
retailers
who
may
buy
furs
later
, , O
he
adds
. . O

Other
furriers
have
also
benefited
from
leathers
. . O

Seymour
Schreibman
, , O
the
65
owner
of
Schreibman
Raphael
Furs
Inc
, , O
treats
the
reverse
side
of
a
Persian
lambskin
to
produce
a
reversible
fur
garment
. . O

He
says
it
accounts
for
25
% NN
of
total
sales
. . O

Mr
Rosen
is
also
pushing
retail
sales
. . O

This
year
he
bought
two
stores
, , O
one
in
Brooklyn
and
one
in
Queens
. . O

Other
furriers
have
also
placed
more
weight
on
retailing
. . O

Golden
Feldman
Furs
Inc
began
retailing
aggressively
eight
years
ago
, , O
and
now
retail
sales
account
for
about
20
% NN
of
gross
income
. . O

In
other
moves
, , O
Mr
Rosen
says
he
bought
a
truck
three
years
ago
to
reach
more
retailers
. . O

Since
then
he
has
expanded
his
fleet
and
can
now
bring
his
furs
to
the
front
door
of
retailers
as
far
away
as
the
Midwest
. . O

Small
retailers
who
ca
n
afford
to
travel
to
his
New
York
showroom
have
become
fair
game
. . O

Such
moves
have
helped
Mr
Rosen
weather
the
industry
slump
of
recent
years
. . O

The
industry
enjoyed
six
prosperous
years
beginning
in
1980
, , O
but
since
1986
sales
have
languished
at
their
$ $ I
1
billion
peak
. . O

Large
furriers
such
as
Antonovich
Inc
, , O
Fur
Vault
Inc
and
Evans
Inc
all
reported
losses
in
their
latest
fiscal
years
. . O

Aftereffects
of
the
1987
stock
market
crash
head
the
list
of
reasons
. . O

In
addition
, , O
competition
has
glutted
the
market
with
both
skins
and
coats
, , O
driving
prices
down
. . O

The
animal
movement
has
n
helped
sales
. . O

Warm
winters
over
the
past
two
years
have
trimmed
demand
, , O
too
, , O
furriers
complain
. . O

And
those
who
did
n
move
some
production
overseas
suffer
labor
shortages
. . O

`` `` O
The
intensive
labor
needed
to
manufacture
furs
-LCB
in
the
U
. . O
-RCB
is
not
as
available
as
it
was
, , O
'' '' O
says
Mr
Schreibman
, , O
who
is
starting
overseas
production
. . O

But
even
those
who
have
found
a
way
to
cope
with
the
imports
and
the
slump
, , O
fear
that
furs
are
losing
part
of
their
allure
. . O

`` `` O
People
are
promoting
furs
in
various
ways
and
taking
the
glamour
out
of
the
fur
business
, , O
'' '' O
says
Stephen
Sanders
, , O
divisional
merchandise
manager
for
Marshall
Field
's
department
store
in
Chicago
. . O

`` `` O
You
ca
n
make
a
commodity
out
of
a
luxury
, , O
'' '' O
insists
Mr
Purnick
, , O
the
New
York
furrier
. . O

He
contends
that
chasing
consumers
with
low
imports
will
harm
the
industry
in
the
long
run
by
reducing
the
prestige
of
furs
. . O

But
Mr
Rosen
responds
: : O
`` `` O
Whatever
people
want
to
buy
, , O
I
'll
sell
. . O

The
name
of
the

economic
indicators

British
Chancellor

improvement
in

U
economy

In
a
speech
prepared
for
delivery
to
London
's

community
, , O
Mr
Lawson
summed
up
current
economic
policy
as
a
battle
to
wring
inflation
out
of
the
British
economy
, , O
using
high
interest
rates
as
`` `` O
the
essential
instrument
'' '' O
to
carry
out
the
campaign
. . O

Two
weeks
after
boosting
base
rates
to
15
% NN
, , O
he
pledged
that
`` `` O
rates
will
have
to
remain
high
for
some
time
to
come
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Lawson
also
made
it
clear
that
he
would
be
watching
exchange
rates
carefully
. . O

A
sinking
pound
makes
imports
more
expensive
and
increases
businesses
' POS
expectations
of
future
inflation
, , O
he
argued
. . O

In
an
apparent
warning
to
currency
traders
who
have
lately
been
selling
the
British
currency
, , O
he
stated
that
the
exchange
rates
will
have
a
`` `` I
major
role
in
the
assessment
of
monetary
conditions

'' '' O

In
reaffirming
the
current
monetary
policy
of
using
high
interest
rates
to
fight
inflation
and
shore
up
the
pound
, , O
Mr
Lawson
dismissed
other
approaches
to
managing
the
economy
. . O

He
said
he
monitors
the
money
figures
, , O
but
does
n
give
them
paramount
importance
, , O
as
some
private
and
government
economists
have
suggested
. . O

Mr
Lawson
also
dismissed
the
possibility
of
imposing
direct
credit
controls
on
Britain
's
financial
system
. . O

Mr
Lawson
's
speech
, , O
delivered
at
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
's
annual
dinner
at
Mansion
House
, , O
came
on
the
heels
of
a
grueling
period
for
the
U
economy
. . O

Two
weeks
ago
, , O
in
a
campaign
to
blunt
inflation
at
home
and
arrest
a
world
plunge
in
the
pound
, , O
he
raised
base
rates
a
full
percentage
point
to
15
% NN
. . O

Despite
the
increase
, , O
the
British
currency
slid
below
a
perceived
threshold
of
three
marks
early
last
week
. . O

It
was
quoted
at
2
marks
in
late
New
York
trading
Wednesday
. . O

Leading
up
to
the
speech
was
a
drumroll
of
economic
statistics
suggesting
that
the
British
war
on
inflation
will
be
more
bruising
than
previously
assumed
. . O

Unemployment
in
September
dropped
to
1
, , O
the
lowest
level
since
1980
. . O

While
lower
joblessness
is
generally
good
news
, , O
the
hefty
drop
last
month
indicates
that
the
economy
is
n
slowing
down
as
much
as
hoped
-- : O
despite
a
doubling
of
interest
rates
over
the
last
16
months
. . O

Meanwhile
, , O
average
earnings
in
Britain
were
up
8
% NN
in
August
over
the
previous
year

Another
inflationary
sign
came

in
building

to
a
record

10

In

separate
speech
prepared

Robin

when
the
British
economy
was
heating
up
last
year

He
added
that
`` `` O
there
's
no
quick
solution

to
the
economic
woes

and
said
`` `` O
tight

C
Olivetti

claiming
it
has
won
the
race
in
Europe
to
introduce
computers
based
on
a
powerful
new
microprocessor
chip
, , O
unveiled
its
CP486
computer
yesterday
. . O

The
product
is
the
first
from
a
European
company
based
on
Intel
Corp
's
new
32
486tm
microprocessor
, , O
which
works
several
times
faster
than
previously
available
chips

Hewlett
Co
became
the
first
company
world
to
announce
a
product
based
on
the
chip
earlier
this
month
, , O
but
it
wo

start
shipping
the
computers
until
early
next

An
Olivetti
spokesman
said
the
company

factories
are
already
beginning
to
produce
the
machine
, , O
and
that
it
should
be
available
in
Europe
by

`` `` O
What
this
means
is
that
Europeans
will
have
these
machines
in
their
offices

'' '' O
the
spokesman
said

The
new
chip
`` `` O
is
a
very
big
step
in
computing

and
it
is
important
that

have
acknowledged
that
in
the
past
they
have
lagged
at
getting
new
technology
to
market

Ms
Davis
said
the
new
machines
could
steal
some
sales
away
from
Olivetti
's
own
minicomputers
, , O
but
would
bring
new
sales
among
professionals
such
as
engineers

stockbrokers

medical
doctors

Although
Olivetti
's
profits
tumbled
40

in
the
first
half
of
this
year
, , O
she
believes
Olivetti
's
restructuring
last
fall
and
its
introduction
of
new
products
will
begin
to
bear
fruit
with
an
earnings
rebound
next

especially
if
it
can
fulfill
its
promise
to
deliver
the
new
machines
by
December

`` `` O
We
think
the
worst
is
over

in
the
European
information
market
, , O
she
said

Depending
on
the
type
of
software
and
peripherals
used
, , O
the
machines
can
serve
either
as
the
main
computer
in
a
network
of
many
terminals
-LRB
a
role
usually
filled
by
a
minicomputer

as

technical
workstation

fast
personal
computer

`` `` O
It

the
missing

in
Olivetti
's
product
line
between
small
personal
computers
and
higher
minicomputers
, , O
the
Olivetti
spokesman
said

He
added
that
Olivetti
will
continue
making
its
LSX
minicomputer
line

The
machines
will
cost
around
$ $ I
16

The
Intel
486
chip
can
process

increasing
the
maximum
SSI
payment
to

The
inflation
adjustment
also
means
that
the
maximum

subject

wage
tax
that
generates

trust
fund

rise

exempt
amount
for
beneficiaries
under

will
rise
to

The
adjustments
reflect
the
increase
in

clerical
workers
from

Health

Medical

for
the
third

despite
sales
increases
of
less

10
% NN

analysts
say

To
offset
sluggish
sales
growth
, , O
companies
have
been
cutting
staff
, , O
mostly
through
attrition
, , O
and
slowing
the
growth
in
research

development
spending

Sales
growth
in

slowed
by
mounting
pressure
from
groups

to
hold

Suppliers
were
also
hurt

Digital
said
a

The

Every

stock

money
manager

portfolio
is
traded
seven
or
eight
times
a

the
firm
estimates

That

the
most
active
trader
among
all
the
nation
's
investment
advisers
, , O
according
to
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filings

But
wait
a
second
. . O

Westridge
Capital
is
an
index
fund
-- : O
the
type
of
stolid
long
investor
whose
goal
is
to
be
nothing
more
than
average
. . O

Westridge
Capital
's
frenetic
trading
reflects
the
changes
sweeping
through
the
previously
sleepy
world
of
indexing
. . O

Indexing
for
the
most
part
has
involved
simply
buying
and
then
holding
stocks
in
the
correct
mix
to
mirror
a
stock
market
barometer
, , O
such
as
Standard
& CC
Poor
's
500
index
, , O
and
match
its
performance
. . O

Institutional
investors
have
poured
$ $ B
210
billion
into
stock
and
bond
indexing
as
a
cheap
and
easy
form
of
investment
management
that
promises
to
post
average
market
returns
. . O

These
big
investors
have
flocked
to
indexing
because
relatively
few
`` `` I
active
'' '' I
stock
pickers
have
been
able
to
consistently
match
the
returns
of
the
S
500
or
other
bellwethers
, , O
much
less
beat
it
. . O

And
the
fees
investors
pay
for
indexing
run
a
few
pennies
for
each
$ $ I
100
of
assets
-- : O
a
fraction
of
the
cost
of
active
managers
. . O

That
's
because
computers
do
most
of
the
work
, , O
and
low
trading
activity
keeps
a
lid
on
commission
costs
. . O

But
today
, , O
indexing
is
moving
from
a
passive
investment
strategy
to
an
increasingly
active
one
. . O

Because
index
managers
are
no
longer
satisfied
with
merely
being
average
, , O
they
have
developed
`` `` B
enhanced
'' '' I
indexing
strategies
that
are
intended
to
outperform
the
market
as
much
as
three
percentage
points
. . O

`` `` O
Indexing
has
been
the
most
single
successful
investment
concept
in
the
last
decade
, , O
but
the
index
money
has
been
just
sort
of
sitting
there
, , O
'' '' O
says
Seth
M
Lynn
, , O
president
of
Axe
Core
Investors
Inc
, , O
an
indexer
based
in
Tarrytown

N
. . O

`` `` O
Now
the
interest
is
in
what
else
can
I
do
with
that
money
. . O
'' '' O

Among
the
souped
indexing
strategies
: : O
Indexed
portfolios
can
be
built
around
thousands
of
stocks
, , O
or
just
a
few
dozen
, , O
rather
than
being
restricted
to
the
S
500
companies
. . O

They
can
ignore
the
S
500
stocks
altogether
and
focus
on
particular
types
of
stocks
, , O
such
as
smaller
companies
, , O
those
paying
high
dividends
or
companies
in
a
particular
industry
, , I
state
or
country
. . O

With
today
's
computer
program
trading
techniques
, , O
index
funds
can
trade
back
and
forth
between
stock
futures
and
the
actual
stocks
making
up
indexes
such
as
the
S
500
. . O

Futures
and
options
also
make
it
possible
to
build
`` `` B
synthetic
'' '' I
index
funds
that
do
n
actually
own
a
single
share
of
stock
, , O
but
can
produce
returns
that
match
or
exceed
the
broad
stock
market
. . O

One
reason
for
these
hybrids
is
that
indexing
's
rapid
growth
is
slowing
, , O
particularly
for
those
`` `` I
plain
vanilla
'' '' I
funds
that
mirror
the
S
500
. . O

`` `` O
There
is
n
a
boatload

of
big
investors

there

waiting
to

funds
now

stock
owned
by
pension
funds

-RRB

A
further
problem
is
razor
profits
. . O

Plain
funds
have
become
so
commonplace
that
fees
they
can
charge
have
plunged
to
almost
nothing
, , O
and
in
some
cases
are
just
that
. . O

To
land
customers
for
their
well
stock
custodial
business

big
banks
sometimes
will
throw
in
basic
indexing
services
for
free

`` `` O
It

like
getting
a
free
toaster
when
you
open
an
account
, , O
'' '' O
says
Axe
Core
's
Mr
Lynn
. . O

As
a
result
, , O
indexers
have
been
looking
for
ways
to
give
investors
something
more
than
the
average
for
their
money
. . O

And
many
have
been
successful
, , O
as
in
the
case
of
the
index
fund
operated
by
hyper
Westridge
Capital
. . O

Westridge
Capital
has
used
enhanced
indexing
techniques
to
beat
the
S
500
's
returns
by
2
to
3
percentage
points
over
the
past
four

with
the

risk
level
as
holding
the
S
500
stocks
, , O
according
to
James
Carder
, , O
the
firm
's
president
. . O

Strategies
vary
for
Westridge
Capital
, , O
which
has
$ $ B
300
million
under
management
. . O

The
firm
sometimes
buys
S
500
futures
when
they
are
selling
at
a
discount
to
the
actual
stocks
, , O
and
will
switch
back
and
forth
between
stocks
and
stock
futures
to
take
advantages
of
any
momentary
price
discrepencies
. . O

Mr
Carder
also
goes
through
periods
when
he
buys
stocks
in
conjunction
with
options
to
boost
returns
and
protect
against
declines
. . O

And
in
some
months
, , O
he
buys
stock
futures
and
not
stocks
at
all
. . O

`` `` O
By
their
nature
, , O
our
trades
are
very
short
and
are
going
to
create
high
turnover

'' '' O
Mr
Carder
adds
. . O

`` `` O
The
more
turnover

the
better
for
our
clients

'' '' O

also
uses
futures
in
a
strategy
that
on

has
added

's
returns
. . O

J
Thomas
Allen
, , O
president

agrees
it

says
John
Zumbrunn
, , O
managing
director
of
Prudential
Insurance
Co
of
America
's
Investment
Index
Technologies
Inc
unit
. . O

Prudential
currently
is
seeking
approval
to
offer
a
new
fund
offering
a
return
equal
to
the
S
500
index
plus
5
of
a
percentage
point
. . O

An
added
feature
is
that
the
slighty
improved
return
would
be
guaranteed
by
Prudential
. . O

There
are
many
other
strategies
to
bolster
the
returns
of
index
funds
. . O

They
include
: : O

LIMITED
RISK
FUNDS
: : O

These
guarantee
protection
against
stock
market
declines
while
still
passing
along
most
gains
. . O

Here
a
fund
may
promise
to
pay
back
, , O
say
, , O
$ $ B
95
of
every
$ $ I
100
invested
for
a
year
, , O
even
if
the
market
goes
much
lower
. . O

The
fund
could
invest
$ $ B
87
for
one
year
in
Treasury
bills
yielding
8
% NN
to
return
the
guaranteed
$ $ I
95
. . O

That
leaves
$ $ B
13
, , O
which
could
be
used
to
buy
S
500
options
that
will
nearly
match
any
gain
in
the
S
index
. . O

MANAGER
REPLICATION
FUNDS
: : O

Say
a
big
investor
is
interested
in
growth
stocks
. . O

Instead
of
hiring
one
of
the
many
active
managers
specializing
in
growth
stocks
, , O
indexers
can
design
a
portfolio
around
the
same
stocks
; : O
the
portfolio
will
be
maintained
by
computer
, , O
reducing
both
fees
and
, , O
in
theory
, , O
risk
-LRB
because
of
the
large
number
of
stocks

`` `` O
We
see
a
lot
of
interest
in
those
kind
of
things
, , O
'' '' O
says
Frank
Salerno
, , O
a
vice
president
of
Bankers
Trust
. . O

`` `` O
People
comfortable
with
the
passive
approach
are
using
them
for
other
strategies
. . O
'' '' O

TILT
FUNDS
: : O

This
is
an
index
fund
with
a
bet
. . O

Instead
of
replicating
the
S
500
or
some
other
index
exactly
, , O
some
stocks
are
overweighted
or
underweighted
in
the
portfolio
. . O

One
simple
approach
is
to
exclude
S
500
companies
considered
bankruptcy
candidates
; : O
this
can
avoid
weak
sisters
, , O
but
also
can
hurt
when
a
company
like
Chrysler
Corp
rebounds
. . O

Another
approach
: : O
An
investor
with
$ $ B
100
million
might
use
$ $ B
75
million
to
buy
the
S
500
index
and
spend
the
other
$ $ I
25
million
on
a
favorite
group
of
stocks
. . O

SPECIALIZED
FUNDS
: : O

Indexes
can
be
constructed
to
serve
social
goals
, , O
such
as
eliminating
the
stocks
of
companies
doing
business
in
South
Africa
. . O

Other
funds
have
been
designed
to
concentrate
on
stocks
in
a
geographic
area
in
order
to
encourage
local
investment
. . O

Pennsylvania
State
Employees
Retirement
System
, , O
for
example
, , O
has
about
$ $ I
130
million
invested
in
a
fund
of
244
companies
that
are
either
Pennsylvania
or
have
25
% NN
of
their
work
forces
in
the
state
. . O

Short
interest
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
declined
for
the
second
consecutive
month
, , O
this
time
4
% NN
, , O
while
the
American
Stock
Exchange
reported
its
third
consecutive
record
month
of
short
interest
. . O

The
Big
Board
reported
that
short
interest
dropped
to
523
shares
as
of
Oct
13
from
547
shares
in
mid
. . O

Amex
short
interest
climbed
3
% NN
to
53
shares
from
51
shares
. . O

For
the
year
month
, , O
the
Big
Board
reported
461
shares
, , O
indicating
a
13
% NN
year
rise
, , O
while
the
Amex
reported
36
shares
, , O
a
48
% NN
leap
. . O

Amex
short
interest
has
been
heading
upward
since
mid
, , O
with
increases
in
each
month
since
then
except
at
mid
. . O

Traders
who
sell
short
borrow
stock
and
sell
it
, , O
betting
that
the
stock
's
price
will
decline
and
that
they
can
buy
the
shares
back
later
at
a
lower
price
for
return
to
the
lender
. . O

Short
interest
is
the
number
of
shares
that
have
n
yet
been
purchased
for
return
to
lenders
. . O

Although
a
substantial
short
position
reflects
heavy
speculation
that
a
stock
's
price
will
decline
, , O
some
investors
consider
an
increase
in
short
interest
bullish
because
the
borrowed
shares
eventually
must
be
bought
back
. . O

Fluctuation
in
short
interest
of
certain
stocks
also
may
be
caused
partly
by
arbitraging
. . O

The
figures
occasionally
include
incomplete
transactions
in
restricted
stock
. . O

The
level
of
negative
sentiment
measured
by
the
Big
Board
short
interest
ratio
slipped
to
3
from
last
month
's
3
. . O

The
ratio
is
the
number
of
trading
days
, , O
at
the
exchange
's
average
trading
volume
, , O
that
would
be
required
to
convert
the
total
short
interest
position
. . O

Some
analysts
suggest
, , O
however
, , O
that
the
ratio
has
weakened
in
value
as
an
indicator
because
options
and
other
products
can
be
used
to
hedge
short
positions

Your
Oct
12
editorial
`` `` O
Pitiful
, , I
Helpless
Presidency
? . O
'' '' O
correctly
states
that
I
was
critical
of
the
Bush
administration
's
failure
to
have
any
plan
in
place
to
respond
in
a
timely
fashion
to
the
opportunities
to
oust
Manuel
Noriega
presented
by
the
attempted
military
coup
on
Oct
3
. . O

You
are
absolutely
wrong
, , O
however
, , O
in
opining
that
this
position
is
some
kind
of
`` `` O
flip
, , O
'' '' O
something
newly
arrived
at
as
a
result
of
reading
the
opinion
polls
. . O

My
position
is
one
founded
on
both
the
facts
and
the
law
. . O

Although
you
may
have
forgotten
, , O
public
opinion
about
Gen
Noriega
is
where
it
is
in
large
measure
because
of
my
investigation
of
his
years
of
involvement
in
narcotics
smuggling
-LRB
and
simultaneous
work
as
a
U
operative
-RRB
. . O

The
public
made
up
its
mind
about
Gen
Noriega
largely
as
a
result
of
the
hearings
I
chaired
in
the
Subcommittee
on
Terrorism
and
Narcotics
of
the
Foreign
Relations
Committee
on
Feb
8
, , I
9
, , I
10
and
11
, , I
1988
, , B
and
again
on
April
4
, , I
1988
. . O

It
was
during
those
hearings
that
the
nation
first
learned
the
breadth
and
depth
of
Gen
Noriega
's
criminality
, , B
and
of
his
enduring
relationships
with
a
variety
of
U
government
agencies
. . O

Those
hearings
also
highlighted
how
Gen
Noriega
was
able
to
use
his
relationships
with
these
agencies
to
delay
U
action
against
him
, , O
and
to
exploit
the
administration
's
obsession
with
overthrowing
the
Sandinistas
to
protect
his
own
drug
. . O

As
former
Ambassador
to
Costa
Rica
Francis
J
McNeil
testified
before
the
subcommittee
, , O
the
Reagan
administration
knew
that
Gen
Noriega
was
involved
with
narcotics
, , O
but
made
a
decision
in
the
summer
of
1986
`` `` O
to
put
Gen
Noriega
on
the
shelf
until
Nicaragua
was
settled
. . O
'' '' O

As
the
report
issued
by
the
subcommittee
concluded
, , O
`` `` O
Our
government
did
nothing
regarding
Gen
Noriega
's
drug
business
and
substantial
criminal
involvement
because
the
first
priority
was
the
Contra
war
. . O

This
decision
resulted
in
at
least
some
drugs
entering
the
United
States
as
a
hidden
cost
of
the
war
. . O
'' '' O

Unfortunately
, , O
this
problem
continued
even
after
Gen
Noriega
's
indictment
. . O

Throughout
1988
and
this
year
, , O
I
and
others
in
Congress
have
pressed
the
U
to
develop
a
plan
for
pushing
this
`` `` I
narcokleptocrat
'' '' O
out
of
Panama
. . O

Regrettably
, , O
two
administrations
in
a
row
have
been
unwilling
and
unable
to
develop
any
plan
, , O
military
or
economic
, , O
for
supporting
the
Panamanian
people
in
their
attempts
to
restore
democracy

Sen

, , O
Mass

-RRB

For
Vietnamese
, , O
these
are
tricky
, , O
often
treacherous
, , O
times
. . O

After
years
of
hesitation
, , O
economic
and
political
reform
was
embraced
at
the
end
of
1986
, , O
but
ringing
declarations
have
yet
to
be
translated
into
much
action
. . O

Vietnam
is
finding
that
turning
a
stagnant
socialist
order
into
a
dynamic
free
market
does
n
come
easy
. . O

Here
is
how
three
Vietnamese
are
coping
with
change
: : O

The
Tire
King

Nguyen
Van
Chan
is
living
proof
that
old
ways
die
hard
. . O

Mr
Chan
used
to
be
an
oddity
in
Hanoi
: : O
a
private
entrepreneur
. . O

His
business
success
made
him
an
official
target
in
pre
days
. . O

Mr
Chan
, , O
now
64
years
old
, , O
invented
a
fountain
pen
he
and
his
family
produced
from
plastic
waste
. . O

Later
, , O
he
marketed
glue
. . O

Both
products
were
immensely
popular
. . O

For
his
troubles
, , O
Mr
Chan
was
jailed
three
times
between
1960
and
1974
. . O

Though
his
operation
was
registered
and
used
only
scrap
, , O
he
was
accused
of
conducting
illegal
business
and
possessing
illegal
materials
. . O

Once
he
was
held
for
three
months
without
being
charged
. . O

Things
were
supposed
to
change
when
Vietnam
's
economic
reforms
gathered
pace
, , O
and
for
awhile
they
did
. . O

After
years
of
experimenting
, , O
Mr
Chan
produced
a
heavy
bicycle
tire
that
outlasted
its
state
rival
. . O

By
1982
, , O
he
was
selling
thousands
of
tires
. . O

Newspapers
published
articles
about
him
, , O
and
he
was
hailed
as
`` `` O
the
tire
king
. . O
'' '' O

His
efforts
earned
a
gold
medal
at
a
national
exhibition
-- : O
and
attracted
renewed
attention
from
local
authorities
. . O

District
police
in
1983
descended
on
his
suburban
home
, , O
which
he
and
his
large
family
used
as
both
residence
and
factory
, , O
and
demanded
proof
the
house
and
equipment
were
his
. . O

He
produced
it
. . O

`` `` O
That
was
the
first
time
they
lost
and
I
won
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
. . O

He
was
further
questioned
to
determine
if
he
was
`` `` O
a
real
working
man
or
an
exploiter
. . O
'' '' O

Says
Mr
Chan
: : O
`` `` O
When
I
showed
it
was
from
my
own
brain
, , O
they
lost
for
the
second
time
. . O
'' '' O

But
a
few
days
later
the
police
accused
him
of
stealing
electricity
, , O
acquiring
rubber
without
permission
and
buying
stolen
property
. . O

Warned
he
was
to
be
jailed
again
, , O
he
fled
to
the
countryside
. . O

His
family
was
given
three
hours
to
leave
before
the
house
and
contents
were
confiscated
. . O

With
only
the
clothes
they
were
wearing
, , O
family
members
moved
to
a
home
owned
by
one
of
Mr
Chan
's
sons
. . O

After
six
months
on
the
run
, , O
Mr
Chan
learned
the
order
for
his
arrest
had
been
canceled
. . O

He
rejoined
his
family
in
January
1984
and
began
the
long
struggle
for
justice
, , O
pressing
everyone
from
Hanoi
municipal
officials
to
National
Assembly
deputies
for
restoration
of
his
rights
. . O

He
and
his
family
kept
afloat
by
repairing
bicycles
, , O
selling
fruit
and
doing
odd
jobs
. . O

Mr
Chan
achieved
a
breakthrough
in
1987
-- : O
and
became
a
minor
celebrity
again
-- : O
when
his
story
was
published
in
a
weekly
newspaper
. . O

In
1988
, , O
18
months
after
the
sixth
congress
formally
endorsed
family
private
enterprise
, , O
district
authorities
allowed
Mr
Chan
to
resume
work
. . O

By
late
last
year
he
was
invited
back
as
`` `` O
the
tire
king
'' '' O
to
display
his
products
at
a
national
exhibition
. . O

National
leaders
stopped
by
his
stand
to
commend
his
achievements
. . O

Mr
Chan
now
produces
1
bicycle
and
motorbike
tires
a
month
and
1
tins
of
tire
glue
in
the
son
's
small
house
. . O

Eighteen
people
pack
the
house
's
two
rooms
-- : O
the
Chans
, , O
four
of
their
10
children
with
spouses
, , O
and
eight
of
22
grandchildren
. . O

Most
sleep
on
the
floor
. . O

Come
daybreak
, , O
eight
family
members
and
two
other
workers
unroll
a
sheet
of
raw
rubber
that
covers
the
floor
of
the
house
and
spills
out
onto
the
street
. . O

The
primitive
operations
also
burst
out
the
back
door
into
a
small
courtyard
, , O
where
an
ancient
press
squeezes
rubber
solution
into
a
flat
strip
and
newly
made
tires
are
cooled
in
a
bathtub
filled
with
water
. . O

Mr
Chan
talks
optimistically
of
expanding
, , O
maybe
even
moving
into
the
import
field
. . O

First
, , O
however
, , O
he
has
unfinished
business
. . O

When
district
authorities
allowed
him
to
resume
manufacturing
, , O
they
released
only
one
of
his
machines
. . O

They
did
n
return
the
rubber
stocks
that
represent
his
capital
. . O

Nor
did
they
return
his
house
and
contents
, , O
which
he
values
at
about
$ $ I
44
. . O

He
wants
to
recover
more
than
just
his
property
, , O
though
. . O

`` `` O
I
want
my
dignity
back
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
. . O

The
Editor

Nguyen
Ngoc
seemed
an
obvious
choice
when
the
Vietnamese
Writers
Association
was
looking
for
a
new
editor
to
reform
its
weekly
newspaper
, , O
Van
Nghe
. . O

After
the
sixth
congress
, , O
journalists
seized
the
opportunity
provided
by
the
liberalization
to
probe
previously
taboo
subjects
. . O

Mr
Ngoc
, , O
57
years
old
, , O
had
solid
reformist
credentials
: : O
He
had
lost
his
official
position
in
the
association
in
he
early
1980s

questioned
the
intrusion

politics
into
literature

Appointed
editor
in

in
July
1987
, , O
Mr
Ngoc
rapidly
turned
the
staid
Van
Nghe
into
Vietnam
's
hottest
paper
. . O

Circulation
soared
as
the
weekly
went
way
beyond
standard
literary
themes
to
cover
Vietnamese
society
and
its
ills
. . O

Readers
were
electrified
by
the
paper
's
audacity
and
appalled
by
the
dark
side
of
life
it
uncovered
. . O

One
article
recounted
a
decade
struggle
by
a
wounded
soldier
to
prove
, , O
officially
, , O
he
was
alive
. . O

Another
described
how
tax
officials
in
Thanh
Hoa
province
one
night
stormed
through
homes
and
confiscated
rice
from
starving
villagers
. . O

The
newspaper
also
ran
a
series
of
controversial
short
stories
by
Nguyen
Huy
Thiep
, , O
a
former
history
teacher
, , O
who
stirred
debate
over
his
interpretation
of
Vietnamese
culture
and
took
a
thinly
veiled
swipe
at
writers
who
had
blocked
his
entry
into
their
official
association

Van
Nghe
quickly
made
influential
enemies

`` `` O
Those
who
manage

writers
reacted
badly

to
the
restyled
paper

Lai
Nguyen
An
, , O
a
literary
critic

After
months
of
internal
rumblings

Mr
Ngoc
was
fired
last
December

His
dismissal
triggered
a
furor
among
intellectuals
that
continues
today

`` `` O

Nguyen

Thi

entrepreneur
of
the
1980s

Her
challenge
is
to
keep
her
fledgling
empire
on
top
in
the
1990s
. . O

Mrs
Thi
did
n
wait
for
the
reforms
to
get
her
start
. . O

She
charged
ahead
of
the
government
and
the
law
to
establish
Hochiminh
City
Food
Co
as
the
biggest
rice
dealer
in
the
country
. . O

Her
success
, , O
which
included
alleviating
an
urban
food
shortage
in
the
early
1980s
, , O
helped
persuade
Hanoi
to
take
the
reform
path
. . O

Her
story
is
becoming
part
of
local
folklore

A
lifelong
revolutionary
with
little
education
who
fought
both
the
French
and
the
U
Saigon
regime
, , O
she
switched
effortlessly
to
commerce
after
the
war
. . O

Her
instincts
were
capitalistic
, , O
despite
her
background
. . O

As
she
rode
over
regulations
, , O
only
her
friendship
with
party
leaders
, , O
including
Nguyen
Van
Linh
, , O
then
Ho
Chi
Minh
City
party
secretary
, , O
kept
her
out
of
jail

Following
Mr
Linh
's
appointment
as
secretary
of
the
party
at
the
sixth
congress
, , O
Mrs
Thi
has
become
the
darling
of
`` `` O
doi
moi
'' '' O
, , O
the
Vietnamese
version
of
perestroika

The
authorities
have
steered
foreign
reporters
to
her
office
to
see
an
example
of
`` `` O
the
new
way
of
thinking

'' '' O

Foreign
publications
have
responded
with
articles
declaring
her
Vietnam
's
richest
woman
. . O

`` `` O
Some
people
call
me
the
communist
billionaire

'' '' O
she
has
told

Actually

67
Mrs
Thi
is
about
as
poor
as
almost
everyone
else
in
this
impoverished
land
. . O

She
has
indeed
turned
Hochiminh
City
Food
into
a
budding
conglomerate
, , O
but
the
company
itself
remains
state
. . O

She
manages
it
with
the
title
of
general
. . O

The
heart
of
the
business
is
the
purchase
of
rice
and
other
commodities
, , O
such
as
corn
and
coffee
, , O
from
farmers
in
the
south
, , O
paying
with
fertilizer
, , O
farm
tools
and
other
items

Last
year
, , O
Hochiminh
City
Food
says
it
bought
two
million
metric
tons
of
unhusked
rice
, , O
more
than
10
% NN
of
the
country
's
output
. . O

The
company
operates
a
fleet
of
trucks
and
boats
to
transport
the
commodities
to
its
warehouses
. . O

A
subsidiary
company
processes
commodities
into
foods
such
as
instant
noodles
that
are
sold
with
the
rice
through
a
vast
retail
network
. . O

In
recent
years
, , O
Mrs
Thi
has
started
to
diversify
the
company
, , O
taking
a
20

stake
in
newly
established

partly
private
Industrial

Commercial

and
setting
up
Saigon
Petro

which
owns
and
operates
Vietnam

first
oil
refinery

Mrs
Thi
says
Hochiminh
City
Food
last
year
increased
pretax
profit
60
% NN
to
the
equivalent
of
about
$ $ I
2
million
on
sales
of
$ $ B
150
million
. . O

She
expects
both
revenue
and
profit
to
gain
this
year
. . O

She
is
almost
cavalier
about
the
possibility
Vietnam
's
reforms
will
create
rivals
on
her
home
turf
. . O

`` `` O
I
do

Western

reported
a
net
loss
of

2
million
, , O
or
nine
cents
a
share
, , O
for
its
first
quarter
ended
Sept

, , O
citing
factors
as
varied
as
hurricane
damage
, , O
an
advance
in
graphics
technology
and
the
strengthening
dollar
. . O

In
the
year
period
, , O
the
company
earned
$ $ B
12
million
, , O
or
45
cents
a
share
, , O
on
sales
of
$ $ B
247
million

Sales
for
the
just
period
fell
to
about
$ $ I
225
million
, , O
the
maker
of
computer
parts
said
. . O

Nonetheless
, , O
Chairman
Roger
W
Johnson
said
he
expects
the
company
to
be
profitable
in
the
current
quarter
. . O

`` `` O
We
are
positioned
to
come
through
, , O
'' '' O
he
said
, , O
noting
that
the
company
's
backlog
was
up
from
the
previous
quarter

In
its
second
quarter
last
year
, , O
Western

earned
$ $ B

share

on
sales

Mr
Johnson
said
Western
Digital
's
plant
in
Puerto
Rico
was
affected
by
Hurricane
Hugo
, , O
losing
three
days
' POS
production
because
of
the
storm
, , O
which
wrecked
much
of
the
Caribbean
island
's
infrastructure
. . O

Although
the
plant
itself
was
n
damaged
, , O
Mr
Johnson
said
millions
of
dollars
in
first
revenue
were
lost
. . O

The
revenue
will
be
regained
in
the
current
period
, , O
he
added
. . O

There
are
no
plans
to
initiate
a
common
stock
dividend
, , O
Mr
Johnson
said
, , O
explaining
that
the
board
continues
to
believe
shareholders
are
best
served
by
reinvesting
excess
cash
. . O

Mr
Johnson
said
the
first
loss
also
heavily
reflected
a
rapid
change
in
graphics
technology
that
left
reseller
channels
with
too
many
of
the
old
computer
graphics
boards
and
too
few
new
monitors
compatible
with
the
new
graphics
boards
. . O

Western
Digital
does
n
make
the
monitors
. . O

An
accelerating
move
by
personal
computer
manufacturers
' POS
to
include
advanced
graphics
capabilities
as
standard
equipment
further
dampened
reseller
purchases
of
Western
Digital
's
equipment
. . O

`` `` O
The
other
areas
of
the
business
-- : O
storage
and
microcomputers
-- : O
were
very
good
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Johnson
said
. . O

He
said
Western
Digital
has
reacted
swiftly
to
the
movement
to
video
graphics
array
, , O
VGA
, , O
graphics
technology
from
the
old
enhanced
graphics
adapter
, , O
EGA
, , O
which
has
a
lower
resolution
standard
, , O
technology
and
now
is
one
of
the
leading
producers
of
these
newer
units
. . O

Other
makers
of
video
controller
equipment
also
were
caught
in
the
EGA
shift
, , O
he
said
, , O
`` `` O
but
we
were
able
to
respond
much
more
quickly
. . O
'' '' O

Still
, , O
Mr
Johnson
said
, , O
`` `` O
our
stock
is
grossly
undervalued
. . O
'' '' O

He
said
the
company
has
cut
operating
expenses
by
about
10
% NN
over
the
last
few
quarters
, , O
while
maintaining
research
and
development
at
about
8
% NN
to
9
% NN
of
sales
. . O

As
part
of
its
reorganization
this
week
, , O
Western
Digital
has
divided
its
business
into
two
segments
-- : O
storage
products
, , O
including
controllers
and
disk
drives
; : O
and
microcomputer
products
, , O
which
include
graphics
, , I
communications
and
peripheral
control
chips
. . O

Graphics
, , I
communications
and
peripheral
control
chips
were
combined
because
, , O
increasingly
, , O
multiple
functions
are
being
governed
by
a
single
chip
. . O

Storage
, , O
which
includes
computer
controllers
and
3
disk
drives
, , O
represents
nearly
two
of
the
company
's
business
. . O

Disk
drives
, , O
which
allow
a
computer
to
access
its
memory
, , O
generated
38
% NN
more
revenue
in
the
most
recent
period
compared
with
the
fiscal
first
quarter
a
year
earlier
. . O

Computer
parts
are
getting
ever
smaller
, , O
Mr
Johnson
said
, , O
a
shrinking
that
has
propelled
laptops
into
position
as
the
fastest
segment
of
the
computer
business
. . O

As
smaller
and
more
powerful
computers
continue
to
be
the
focus
of
the
industry
, , O
he
said
, , O
Western
Digital
is
strengthening
development
of
laptop
parts
. . O

Next
year
Western
Digital
plans
to
consolidate
its
operations
from
11
buildings
in
Irvine
into
two
buildings
in
the
same
city
a
new
headquarters
and
, , O
a
block
away
, , O
a
modern
$ $ I
100
million
silicon
wafer
fabrication
plant
. . O

The
plan
will
help
the
company
in
its
existing
joint
manufacturing
agreement
with
AT
. . O

About
half
of
Western
Digital
's
business
is
overseas
, , O
and
Mr
Johnson
expects
that
proportion
to
continue
. . O

Plans
to
dissolve
many
of
the
trade
barriers
within
Europe
in
1992
creates
significant
opportunities
for
the
company
, , O
he
said
, , O
particularly
since
Western
Digital
already
manufactures
there
. . O

Capitalizing
on
that
presence
, , O
Western
Digital
is
launching
a
major
effort
to
develop
the
embryonic
reseller
market
in
Europe
. . O

The

in

Domestic
lending

the

recent

financial
troubles

the
institution

executive

Ismail

Speaking
to
reporters
this
week
after
Bank
Bumiputra
's
shareholders
approved
a
rescue
plan
, , O
Tan
Sri
Basir
said
heavy
lending
to
the
property
sector
rocked
the
bank
when
property
prices
in
Malaysia
plummeted
in
1984
. . O

He
said
the
bank
could
n
wait
any
longer
for
prices
to
recover
and
for
borrowers
to
service
their
loans
. . O

So
the
bank
's
board
decided
to
make
1
billion
Malaysian
dollars
-LRB
US
457
million
-RRB
in
provisions
for
interest
payments
from
loans
previously
recorded
as
revenue
but
never
actually
received
by
the
bank
, , O
and
to
submit
a
bailout
package
to
replenish
the
bank
's
paid
capital
. . O

The
predicament
, , O
he
added
, , O
was
similar
to
the
Hong
Kong
1982
property
collapse
, , O
which
exposed
the
involvement
of
Bank
Bumiputra
's
former
subsidiary
in
the
colony
in
the
largest
banking
scandal
in
Malaysia
's
history
. . O

The
subsidiary
, , O
Bumiputra
Malaysia
Finance
Ltd
, , O
was
left
with
M
2
billion
in
bad
loans
made
to
Hong

property
speculators

Both

wiped

In

years
, , O
Petronas
, , O
which
became
the
dominant

in

rescue
exercise

spent
about

up

Tan
Sri
Basir
said
the
capital
restructuring
plan
has
been
approved
by
Malaysia
's
Capital
Issues
Committee
and
central
bank

Malaysia
's
High
Court
is
expected
to
approve

plan

Once
the
plan
is
approved

Tan
Sri
Basir
said
, , O
most
of
Bank
Bumiputra
's
nonperforming
loans
will
have
been
fully
provided
for

the
bank
will
be
on
track
to
report
a
pretax
profit
of
between
M
160
million
and
M
170
million
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
March
31

For
the
previous
financial
year
, , O
the
bank
would
have
reported
a
pretax
profit
of
M
168
million
if
it
had
n
made
provisions
for
the
nonperforming
loans

he
said

Malaysia
's
Banking
Secrecy
Act
prohibited
the
bank
from
identifying
delinquent
borrowers
, , O
said
Tan
Sri
Basir
. . O

But
public
documents
indicate
10
% NN
or
more
of
the
bank

provisions

made
for
foregone
interest
on
a
M
200
million
loan

Malaysia
's
dominant
political
party
, , O
the
United
Malays
National
Organization

to
build
its
convention

The

`` `` O

refused

to

As
well
as
the
M
1
billion
in
provisions
announced
on
Oct
6
, , O
the
restructuring
package
covers
an
additional
M
450
million
in
provisions
made
in
earlier
years

never
reflected
in

At

end

the
exercise

the
cash
injection
from

increase
the

capital
to

When

Ms

opened
her

she
stepped
into

Now
she
leads

abortion
campaign
in

`` `` O
This

after

for

from
the
issue

Before
July
, , O
pro
voters
could
safely
make
political
decisions
without
focusing
narrowly
on
abortion
. . O

Now
, , O
the
threat
of
further
restrictions
adds
a
new
dimension
, , O
bringing
an
upsurge
in
political
activity
by
abortion
forces
. . O

A
recent
pro
rally
in
Trenton
drew
thousands
, , O
and
in
a
major
reversal
, , O
Congress
is
defying
a
presidential
veto
and
demanding
that
Medicaid
abortions
be
permitted
in
cases
of
rape
and
incest
. . O

`` `` O
If
Webster
had

happened

you
would

be

Linda
Bowker
tells
a
reporter
in

Trenton
office

National
Organization
for

`` `` O
We
could
have
shouted
from
the

'' '' O

New
Jersey
is
a
proving
ground
for
this
aggressive
women
movement
this
year
. . O

The
infusion
of
activists
can
bring
a
clash
of
cultures
. . O

In
Cherry
Hill
, , O
the
National
Abortion
Rights
Action
League
, , O
whose
goal
is
to
sign
up
50
pro
voters
, , O
targets
a
union
breakfast
to
build
labor
support
for
its
cause
. . O

The
league
organizers
seem
more
a
fit
with
a
convention
next
door
of
young
aerobics
instructors
in
leotards
than
the
beefy
union
leaders
; : O
`` `` O
I
wish
I
could
go
work
out

'' '' O
says
a
slim
activist

A
labor
chief
speaks
sardonically
of
having
to
`` `` I

Election
Day
phones
. . O

No
age
group
is
more
sensitive
than
younger
voters
, , O
like
Ms
Ehman
. . O

A
year
ago
this
fall
, , O
New
Jersey
voters
under
30
favored
George
Bush
by
56
% NN
to
39
% NN
over
Michael
Dukakis
, , O
according
to
a
survey
then
by
Rutgers
University
's
Eagleton
Institute
. . O

A
matching
Eagleton
Star
Ledger
poll
last
month
showed
a
complete
reversal
. . O

Voters
in
the
same
age
group
backed
Democrat
Florio
55
% NN
to
29
% NN
over
Republican
Courter
. . O

Abortion
alone
ca
n
explain
this
shift
, , O
but
New
Jersey
is
a
model
of
how
so
personal
an
issue
can
become
a
baseline
of
sorts
in
judging
a
candidate
. . O

By
a
2
ratio
, , O
voters
appear
more
at
ease
with
Mr
Florio
's
stance
on
abortion
, , O
and
polls
indicate
his
lead
widens
when
the
candidates
are
specifically
linked
to
the
issue
. . O

`` `` O
The
times
are
my
times
, , O
'' '' O
says
Mr
Florio
. . O

The
Camden
County
congressman
still
carries
himself
with
a
trademark
`` `` I
I
'' '' I
intensity
, , O
but
at
a
pause
in
Newark
's
Columbus
Day
parade
recently
, , O
he
was
dancing
with
his
wife
in
the
middle
of
the
avenue
in
the
city
's
old
Italian
ward
. . O

After
losing
by
fewer
than
1
votes
in
the
1981
governor
's
race
, , O
he
has
prepared
himself
methodically
for
this
moment
, , O
including
deciding
in
recent
years
he
could
no
longer
support
curbs
on
federal
funding
for
Medicaid
abortions
. . O

`` `` O
If
you
're
going
to
be
consistent
and
say
it
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right
, , O
'' '' O
he
asks
, , O
`` `` O
how
are
you
going
to
say
an
upscale
woman
who
can
drive
to
the
hospital
or
clinic
in
a
nice
car
has
a
constitutional
right
and
someone
who
is
not
in
great
shape
financially
does
not
? . O
'' '' O

Mr
Courter
, , O
by
comparison
, , O
seems
a
shadow
of
the
confident
hawk
who
defended
Oliver
North
before
national
cameras
at
Iran
hearings
two
years
ago
. . O

Looking
back
, , O
he
says
he
erred
by
stating
his
`` `` I
personal
'' '' I
opposition
to
abortion
instead
of
assuring
voters
that
he
would
n
impose
his
views
on
`` `` O
policy
'' '' O
as
governor
. . O

It
is
a
distinction
that
satisfies
neither
side
in
the
debate
. . O

`` `` O
He
does
n
know
himself
, , O
'' '' O
Kathy
Stanwick
of
the
Abortion
Rights
League
says
of
Mr
Courter
's
position
. . O

Even
abortion
opponents
, , O
however
angry
with
Mr
Florio
, , O
ca
n
hide
their
frustration
with
the
Republican
's
ambivalence
. . O

`` `` O
He
does
n
want
to
lead
the
people
, , O
'' '' O
says
Richard
Traynor
, , O
president
of
New
Jersey
Right
to
Life
. . O

Moreover
, , O
by
stepping
outside
the
state
's
pro
tradition
, , O
Mr
Courter
aggravates
fears
that
he
is
too
conservative
as
well
on
more
pressing
concerns
such
as
auto
insurance
rates
and
the
environment
. . O

He
hurt
himself
further
this
summer
by
bringing
homosexual
issues
into
the
debate
; : O
and
by
wavering
on
this
issue
and
abortion
, , O
he
has
weakened
his
credibility
in
what
is
already
a
mean
campaign
on
both
sides
. . O

Elected
to
Congress
in
1978
, , O
the
48
Mr
Courter
is
part
of
a
generation
of
young
conservatives
who
were
once
very
much
in
the
lead
of
the
rightward
shift
under
Mr
Reagan
. . O

Like
many
of
his
colleagues
, , O
he
did
n
serve
in
Vietnam
in
the
1960s
yet
embraced
a
hawkish
defense
and
foreign
policy
-- : O
even
voting
against
a
1984
resolution
critical
of
the
U
mining
of
Nicaraguan
harbors
. . O

Jack
Kemp
and
the
writers
Irving
Kristol
and
George
Gilder
were
influences
, , O
and
Mr
Courter
's
own
conservative
credentials
proved
useful
to
the
current
New
Jersey
GOP
governor
, , O
Thomas
Kean
, , O
in
the
1981
Republican
primary
here
. . O

The
same
partnership
is
now
crucial
to
Mr
Courter
's
fortunes
, , O
but
the
abortion
issue
is
only
a
reminder
of
the
gap
between
his
record
and
that
of
the
more
moderate
, , I
pro
Gov
Kean
. . O

While
the
Warren
County
congressman
pursued
an
anti
, , I
anti
agenda
in
Washington
, , O
Gov
Kean
was
approving
increased
income
and
sales
taxes
at
home
and
overseeing
a
near
doubling
in
the
size
of
New
Jersey
's
budget
in
his
eight
years
in
office
. . O

Kean
forces
play
down
any
differences
with
Mr
Courter
, , O
but
this
history
makes
it
harder
for
the
conservative
to
run
against
government
. . O

Mr
Courter
's
free
plan
to
bring
down
auto
insurance
rates
met
criticism
from
Gov
Kean
's
own
insurance
commissioner
. . O

Mr
Courter
is
further
hobbled
by
a
record
of
votes
opposed
to
government
regulation
on
behalf
of
consumers
. . O

Fluent
in
Spanish
from
his
days
in
the
Peace
Corps
, , O
Mr
Courter
actively
courts
minority
voters
but
seems
oddly
over
his
head
. . O

He
is
warm
and
polished
before
a
Puerto
Rican
Congress
in
Asbury
Park
. . O

Yet
minutes
after
promising
to
appoint
Hispanics
to
high
posts
in
state
government
, , O
he
is
unable
to
say
whether
he
has
ever
employed
any
in
his
congressional
office
. . O

`` `` O
I
do
n
think
we
do
now
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
. . O

`` `` O
I
think
we
did
. . O
'' '' O

Asked
the
same
question
after
his
appearance
, , O
Democrat
Florio
identifies
a
staff
member
by
name
and
explains
her
whereabouts
today
. . O

When
he
is
presented
with
a
poster
celebrating
the
organization
's
20th
anniversary
, , O
he
recognizes
a
photograph
of
one
of
the
founders
and
recalls
time
spent
together
in
Camden
. . O

Details
and
Camden
are
essential
Florio
. . O

Elected
to
Congress
as
a
`` `` I
Watergate
baby
'' '' O
in
1974
, , O
he
ran
for
governor
three
years
later
. . O

In
the
opinion
of
many
, , O
he
has
n
stopped
running
since
, , O
even
though
he
declined
a
rematch
with
Gov
Kean
in
1985
. . O

His
base
in
South
Jersey
and
on
the
House
Energy
and
Commerce
Committee
helped
him
sustain
a
network
of
political
committees
to
preserve
his
edge
. . O

With
limited
budgets
for
television
in
a
high
market
, , O
Mr
Florio
's
higher
recognition
than
his
rival
is
a
major
advantage
. . O

More
than
ever
, , O
his
pro
and
pro
record
is
in
sync
with
the
state
. . O

Auto
insurance
rates
are
soaring
. . O

A
toxic
fire
destroyed
part
of
an
interstate
highway
this
summer
. . O

In
Monmouth
, , O
an
important
swing
area
, , O
Republican
freeholders
now
run
on
a
slogan
promising
to
keep
the
county
`` `` O
clean
and
green
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Florio
savors
this
vindication
, , O
but
at
age
52
, , O
the
congressman
is
also
a
product
of
his
times
and
losses
. . O

He
speaks
for
the
death
penalty
as
if
reading
from
Exodus
21
; : O
to
increase
state
revenue
he
focuses
not
on
`` `` O
taxes
'' '' O
but
on
`` `` O
audits
'' '' O
to
cut
waste
. . O

Hard
consultants
match
ads
with
Mr
Courter
's
team
, , O
and
Mr
Florio
retools
himself
as
the
lean
, , I
mean
Democratic
fighting
machine
of
the
1990s
. . O

Appealing
to
a
young
audience
, , O
he
scraps
an
old
reference
to
Ozzie
and
Harriet
and
instead
quotes
the
Grateful
Dead
. . O

The
lyric
chosen
-- : O
`` `` O
long
strange
night
'' '' O
-- : O
may
be
an
apt
footnote
to
television
spots
by
both
candidates
intended
to
portray
each
other
as
a
liar
. . O

The
Democratic
lawmaker
fits
a
pattern
of
younger
reformers
arising
out
of
old
machines
, , O
but
his
ties
to
Camden
remain
a
sore
point
because
of
the
county
's
past
corruption
. . O

His
campaign
hierarchy
is
chosen
from
elsewhere
in
the
state
, , O
and
faced
with
criticism
of
a
sweetheart
bank
investment
, , O
he
has
so
far
blunted
the
issue
by
donating
the
bulk
of
his
profits
to
his
alma
mater
, , O
Trenton
State
College
. . O

Mr
Florio
's
forcefulness
on
the
abortion
issue
after
the
Webster
ruling
divides
some
of
his
old
constituency
. . O

Pasquale
Pignatelli
, , O
an
unlikely
but
enthusiastic
pipe
major
in
an
Essex
County
Irish
bagpipe
band
, , O
speaks
sadly
of
Mr
Florio
. . O

`` `` O
I
am

devout
Catholic

says
Mr
Pignatelli
, , O
a
40
health
officer

`` `` O
I

n
support
him
because
of
abortion

Bill
Wames

72

is
Catholic
too
, , O
but
unfazed
by
Mr
Florio

stand
on
abortion

`` `` O

Consumer

moderate
0

pushed
up
mostly
by
a
jump
in
clothing
costs

the
Labor
Department
reported

Energy
costs

which
drove
wholesale
prices
up
sharply

the
month

continued
to
decline

the
retail
level

pulling
down
transportation

The
report
was
the
brightest
news
the
financial

seen
since
before
the
stock
market
plunged
more
than
190
points
last
Friday

The
Dow

Industrial
Average
rallied
on
the
news

closing
39
points

Bond
prices
also
jumped
as
traders
appeared
to
read
the
data
as
a
sign
that
interest
rates
may
fall
. . O

But
many
economists
were
not
nearly
as
jubilant
. . O

The
climb
in
wholesale
energy
prices
is
certain
to
push
up
retail
energy
prices
in
the
next
few
months
, , O
they
warned
. . O

They
also
said
the
dollar
is
leveling
off
after
a
rise
this
summer
that
helped
to
reduce
the
prices
of
imported
goods
. . O

`` `` O
I
think
inflation
is
going
to
pick
up
through
the
fall

'' '' O
said
Joel
Popkin
, , O
a
specialist
on
inflation
who
runs
an
economic
consulting
firm
here

`` `` O
It
has
been
in
what
I
would
describe
as
a
lull
for
the
past
several
months

'' '' O

`` `` O
We
've
had
whopping
declines
in
consumer
energy
prices
in
each
of
the
past
three
months

and
at
the
wholesale
level
those
are
fully
behind
us
now
, , O
'' '' O
said
Jay
Woodworth
, , O
chief
domestic
economist
at
Bankers
Trust
Co
in
New
York
. . O

Because
wholesale
energy
prices
shot
up
by
a
steep
6
% NN
last
month
, , O
many
analysts
expected
energy
prices
to
rise
at
the
consumer
level
too
. . O

As
a
result
, , O
many
economists
were
expecting
the
consumer
price
index
to
increase
significantly
more
than
it
did
. . O

But
retail
energy
prices
declined
0
% NN
in
September
. . O

Though
analysts
say
competition
will
probably
hold
down
increases
in
retail
energy
prices
, , O
many
expect
some
of
the
wholesale
rise
to
be
passed
along
to
the
consumer
before
the
end
of
the
year
. . O

Still
, , O
some
analysts
insisted
that
the
worst
of
the
inflation
is
behind
. . O

`` `` O
It
increasingly
appears
that
1987
was
a
temporary
inflation
blip
and
not
the
beginning
of
a
cyclical
inflation
problem
, , O
'' '' O
argued
Edward
Yardeni
, , O
chief
economist
at
Prudential
Securities
Inc
in
New
York
. . O

In
both
1987
and
1988
, , O
consumer
prices
rose
4
% NN
. . O

A
run
in
world
oil
prices
last
winter
sent
consumer
prices
soaring
at
a
6
% NN
annual
rate
in
the
first
five
months
of
this
year
, , O
but
the
subsequent
decline
in
energy
prices
has
pulled
the
annual
rate
back
down
to
4
% NN
. . O

Mr
Yardeni
predicted
that
world
business
competition
will
continue
to
restrain
prices
. . O

`` `` O
The
bottom
line
is
, , O
it
seems
to
me
that
the
economic
environment
has
become
very
, , I
very
competitve
for
a
lot
of
businesses
, , O
'' '' O
he
said
. . O

`` `` O
Back
in
1987
, , O
business
was
operating
at
fairly
tight
capacity
, , O
so
businesses
felt
they
could
raise
prices
. . O
'' '' O

Now
, , O
he
said
, , O
a
slowdown
in
economic
activity
has
slackened
demand
. . O

The
mild
inflation
figures
renewed
investors
' POS
hopes
that
the
Federal
Reserve
will
ease
its
interest
stance
. . O

The
steep
climb
in
producer
prices
reported
last
Friday
fostered
pessimism
about
lower
interest
rates
and
contributed
to
the
stock
market
's
6
% NN
plunge
that
day
. . O

In
the
past
several
days
, , O
however
, , O
the
U
's
central
bank
has
allowed
a
key
interest
rate
to
fall
slightly
to
try
to
stabilize
the
markets
. . O

Analysts
say
Fed
policy
makers
have
been
wary
of
relaxing
credit
too
much
because
they
were
still
uncertain
about
the
level
of
inflation
in
the
economy

Excluding
the
volatile
categories
of
energy
and
food
-- : O
leaving
what
some
economists
call
the
core
inflation
rate
-- : O
consumer
prices
still
rose
only
0
% NN
in
September
. . O

Transportation
costs
actually
fell
0
% NN
, , O
and
housing
costs
gained
only
0
% NN
. . O

Apparel
prices
rocketed
up
1
% NN
, , O
but
that
was
after
three
months
of
declines

Medical
costs
continued
their
steep
ascent

rising
0
% NN
after
four
consecutive
months
of
0
% NN
increases

Car
prices
, , O
another
area
that
contributed
to
the
steep
rise
in
the
wholesale
index
last
month

still
showed
declines
at
the
consumer
level

They
dropped
0
% NN
as
dealers
continued

offer
rebates

attract
customers

far
slower
than
the
monthly
rises
earlier
in
the
year
. . O

Separately
, , O
the
Labor
Department
reported
that
average
weekly
earnings
rose
0
% NN
in
September
, , O
after
adjusting
for
inflation
, , O
following
a
0
% NN
decline
in
August
. . O

All
the
numbers
are
adjusted
for
seasonal
fluctuations
. . O

Here
are
the
seasonally
adjusted
changes
in
the
components
of
the
Labor
Department
's
consumer
price
index
for
September
. . O

After
watching
interest
in
the
sport
plummet
for
years
, , O
the
ski
industry
is
trying
to
give
itself
a
lift
. . O

Across
the
country
, , O
resorts
are
using
everything
from
fireworks
to
classical
concerts
to
attract
new
customers
. . O

Some
have
built
health
spas
, , O
business
centers
and
shopping
villages
so
visitors
have
more
to
do
than
ski
. . O

And
this
week
, , O
the
industry
's
efforts
will
go
national
for
the
first
time
when
it
unveils
a
$ $ I
7
million
advertising
campaign
. . O

Such
efforts
-- : O
unheard
of
only
a
few
years
ago
-- : O
are
the
latest
attempts
to
revive
the
sagging
$ $ I
1
billion
U
ski
industry
. . O

Since
the
start
of
the
decade
, , O
lift
sales
have
grown
only
3
% NN
a
year
on
average
, , O
compared
with
16
% NN
annual
growth
rates
in
the
'60s
and
'70s
. . O

Last
season
, , O
lift
sales
fell
for
the
first
time
in
seven
years
. . O

By
some
estimates
, , O
nearly
a
fourth
of
all
U
ski
areas
have
been
forced
to
shut
down
since
the
early
'80s
. . O

Competition
and
mounting
insurance
and
equipment
costs
have
been
the
undoing
of
many
resorts
. . O

But
another
big
problem
has
been
the
aging
of
baby
boomers
. . O

Skiing
, , O
after
all
, , O
has
mainly
been
for
the
young
and
daring
and
many
baby
boomers
have
outgrown
skiing
or
have
too
many
family
responsibilities
to
stick
with
the
sport
. . O

In
its
new
ad
campaign
, , O
created
by
D
Masius
Benton
& CC
Bowles
Inc
, , O
Chicago
, , O
the
ski
industry
is
trying
to
change
its
image
as
a
sport
primarily
for
young
white
people
. . O

One
60
TV
spot
features
a
diverse
group
of
skiers
gracefully
gliding
down
sun
slopes
: : O
senior
citizens
, , O
minorities
, , O
families
with
children
-- : B
even
a
blind
skier
. . O

`` `` O
Ski
school
is
great
, , O
'' '' O
cries
out
a
tot
, , O
bundled
in
a
snowsuit
as
he
plows
down
a
bunny
slope
. . O

`` `` O
You
'll
never
know
'til
you
try
, , O
'' '' O
says
a
black
skier
. . O

`` `` O
We
used
to
show
some
hot
skier
in
his
twenties
or
thirties
going
over
the
edge
of
a
cliff
, , O
'' '' O
says
Kathe
Dillmann
, , O
a
spokeswoman
for
the
United
Ski
Industries
Association
, , O
the
trade
group
sponsoring
the
campaign
. . O

Ski
promotions
have
traditionally
avoided
the
touchy
issue
of
safety
. . O

But
the
new
commercials
deal
with
it
indirectly
by
showing
a
woman
smiling
as
she
tries
to
get
up
from
a
fall
. . O

`` `` O
We
wanted
to
show
it
's
okay
if
you
fall
, , O
'' '' O
says
Ms
Dillmann
. . O

`` `` O
Most
people
think
if
you
slip
, , O
you
'll
wind
up
in
a
body
cast

'' '' O

The
ad
campaign
represents
an
unusual
spirit
of
cooperation
among
resorts
and
ski
equipment
makers
; : O
normally
, , O
they
only
run
ads
hyping
their
own
products
and
facilities
. . O

But
in
these
crunch
times
for
the
ski
industry
, , O
some
resorts
, , O
such
as
the
Angel
Fire
, , I
Red
River
and
Taos
ski
areas
in
New
Mexico
, , O
have
even
started
shuttle
skiers
to
each
other
's
slopes
and
next
year
plan
to
sell
tickets
good
for
all
local
lifts
. . O

Many
resorts
also
are
focusing
more
on
the
service
side
of
their
business
. . O

Since
40
% NN
of
skiers
are
parents
, , O
many
slopes
are
building
nurseries
, , O
expanding
ski
schools
and
adding
entertainment
for
kids
. . O

Vail
, , O
Colo
, , O
now
has
a
playland
that
looks
like
an
old
mining
town
; : O
kids
can
ski
through
and
pan
for
fool
's
gold
. . O

For
$ $ B
15
, , O
they
can
enjoy
their
own
nightly
entertainment
, , O
with
dinner
, , O
without
mom
and
dad
. . O

A
few
years
ago
, , O
parents
usually
had
to
hire
a
sitter
or
take
turns
skiing
while
one
spouse
stayed
with
the
children
. . O

`` `` O
Most
parents
who
had
to
go
through
that
never
came
back
, , O
'' '' O
says
Michael
Shannon
, , O
president
of
Vail
Associates
Inc
, , O
which
owns
and
operates
the
Vail
and
nearby
Beaver
Creek
resorts
. . O

To
make
skiing
more
convenient
for
time
visitors
, , O
several
resorts
are
buying
or
starting
their
own
travel
agencies
. . O

In
one
phone
call
, , O
ski
buffs
can
make
hotel
and
restaurant
reservations
, , O
buy
lift
tickets
, , O
rent
ski
equipment
and
sign
up
for
lessons
. . O

And
resorts
are
adding
other
amenities
, , O
such
as
pricey
restaurants
, , O
health
spas
and
vacation
packages
with
a
twist
. . O

During
Winter
Carnival
week
, , O
for
example
, , O
visitors
at
Sunday
River
in
Maine
can
take
a
hot
balloon
ride
. . O

`` `` O
People
these
days
want
something
else
to
do
besides
ski
and
sit
in
the
bar
, , O
'' '' O
says
Don
Borgeson
, , O
executive
director
of
Angel
Fire
, , O
N
's
Chamber
of
Commerce
. . O

The
ski
industry
hopes
to
increase
the
number
of
skiers
by
3
million
to
about
21
million
in
the
next
five
years
with
its
latest
ads
and
promotions
. . O

But
some
think
that
's
being
overly
optimistic
. . O

For
one
thing
, , O
it
may
be
tough
to
attract
people
because
skiing
is
still
expensive
: : O
a
lift
ticket
can
cost
up
to
$ $ I
35
a
day
and
equipment
prices
are
rising
. . O

And
most
vacationers
still
prefer
a
warm
climate
for
their
winter
excursions
. . O

An
American
Express
Co
survey
of
its
travel
agents
revealed
that
only
34
% NN
believe
their
clients
will
pick
a
trip
this
winter
based
on
the
availability
of
winter
sports
, , O
as
opposed
to
69
% NN
who
think
that
warm
sports
will
be
the
deciding
factor
. . O

`` `` O
Even
if
they
could
bring
in
that
many
new
skiers

I
do

know
if
-LCB
the
industry

could
handle
that
kind
of
an
increase

William

`` `` O
Most

They

did

you
? . O

They
are
supposed
to
play
the
game
next
Tuesday
, , O
in
Candlestick
Park
here

The
theory
is
that
the
stadium
, , O
damaged
by
Tuesday
's
earthquake
, , O
will
be
repaired
by
then
, , O
and
that
people
will

there
. . O

Like
just
about
everything
else

that
remains
to
be
seen

Aftershocks
could
intervene

But
, , O
at
least
, , O
the
law
of
averages
should
have
swung
to
the
favorable
side
. . O

It
may
seem
trivial
to
worry
about
the
World
Series
amid
the
destruction
to
the
Bay
Area
wrought
by
Tuesday
's
quake
, , O
but
the
name
of
this
column
is
`` `` O
On
Sports
, , O
'' '' O
so
I
feel
obliged
to
do
so
. . O

You
might
be
interested
to
know
that
baseball
, , I
not
survival
, , O
appeared
to
be
the
first
thought
of
most
of
the
crowd
of
60
that
had
gathered
at
Candlestick
at
5
p
Tuesday
, , O
a
half
before
game
time
, , O
when
the
quake
struck
. . O

As
soon
as
the
tremor
passed
, , O
many
people
spontaneously
arose
and
cheered
, , O
as
though
it
had
been
a
novel
kind
of
pre
show
. . O

One
fan
, , O
seated
several
rows
in
front
of
the
open

upper
auxiliary
press
section
where
I
was
stationed

faced
the
assembled
newsies
and
laughingly
shouted
, , O
`` `` O
We
arranged
that
just
for
you
guys

'' '' O

I
thought
and
, , O
I
'm
sure
, , O
others
did
: : O
`` `` O
You
should
n
have
bothered

'' '' O

I
'd
slept
through
my
only
previous
brush
with
natural
disaster
, , O
a
tornado
15
or
so
summers
ago
near
Traverse
City
, , O
Mich
, , O
so
I
was
unprepared
for
one
reaction
to
such
things
: : O
the
urge
to
talk
about
them
. . O

Perhaps
primed
by
the
daily
diet
of
radio
and
TV
reporters
thrusting
microphones
into
people
's
faces
and
asking
how
they
`` `` B
feel
'' '' O
about
one
calamity
or
another
, , O
fellow
reporters
and
civilians
who
spied
my
press
credential
were
eager
to
chat
. . O

`` `` O
It
felt
like
I
was
on
a
station
platform
and
a
train
went
by
, , O
'' '' O
said
one
man
, , O
describing
my
own
reaction
. . O

A
women
said
she
saw
the
park
's
light
standards
sway
. . O

A
man
said
he
saw
the
upper
rim
undulate
. . O

I
saw
neither
. . O

Dictates
of
good
sense
to
the
contrary
not
withstanding
, , O
the
general
inclination
was
to
believe
that
the
disturbance
would
be
brief
and
that
ball
would
be
played
. . O

`` `` O
I
was
near
the
top
of

and
saw
a
steel
girder

feet
from
where

sat

but
I
stayed

for
10
or
15
minutes

'' '' O
confessed
a
friend

`` `` O
I

` `` O

' '' O
'' '' O

Here
in
the
Global
Village
, , O
though
, , O
folks
do
not
stay
uninformed
for
long
. . O

Electrical
power
was
out
in
still
Candlestick
Park
, , O
but
battery
radios
and
television
sets
were
plentiful
. . O

Within
a
few
minutes
, , O
the
true
extent
of
the
catastrophe
was
becoming
clear
. . O

Its
Richter
Scale
measurement
was
reported
as
6
, , O
then
6
, , O
then
7
. . O

A
section
of
the
Bay
Bridge
had
collapsed
, , O
as
had
a
part
of
Interstate
Highway
880
in
Oakland
. . O

People
had
died
. . O

At
5
p
, , O
scheduled
game
time
having
passed
, , O
some
fans
chanted
`` `` O
Let
's
Play
Ball
. . O
'' '' O

No
longer
innocent
, , O
they
qualified
as
fools
. . O

The
stadium
was
ordered
evacuated
soon
afterward
; : O
the
announcement
, , O
made
over
police
bullhorns
, , O
cited
the
power
outage
, , O
but
it
later
was
revealed
that
there
also
had
been
damage
of
the
sort
reported
by
my
friend
. . O

Outside
, , O
I
spotted
two
young
men
lugging
blocks
of
concrete
. . O

`` `` O
Pieces
of
Candlestick
, , O
'' '' O
they
said
. . O

The
crowd
remained
good
natured
, , O
even
bemused
. . O

TV
reporters
interviewed
fans
in
the
parking
lots
while
, , O
a
few
feet
away
, , O
others
watched
the
interviews
on
their
portable
TVs
. . O

The
only
frenzy
I
saw
was
commercial
: : O
Booths
selling
World
Series
commemorative
stamps
and
dated
postmarks
were
besieged
by
fledgling
speculators
who
saw
future
profit
in
the
items
. . O

The
traffic
jam
out
of
the
park
was
monumental
. . O

It
took
me
a
half
to
move
10
feet
from
my
parking
spot
in
an
outer
lot
to
an
aisle
, , O
and
an
additional
hour
to
reach
an
inner
roadway
a
half
away
. . O

The
six
trip
to
my
airport
hotel
that
had
taken
20
minutes
earlier
in
the
day
took
more
than
three
hours
. . O

At
my
hotel
, , O
the
Westin
, , O
power
was
out
, , O
some
interior
plaster
had
broken
loose
and
there
had
been
water
damage
, , O
but
little
else
. . O

With
Garpian
randomness
, , O
a
hotel
across
the
street
, , O
the
Amfac
, , O
had
been
hit
harder
: : O
A
large
sheet
of
its
concrete
facade
and
several
window
balconies
were
torn
away
. . O

The
Westin
staff
had
, , O
kindly
, , O
set
out
lighted
candles
in
the
ballroom
, , O
prepared
a
cold
buffet
and
passed
around
pillows
and
blankets
. . O

I
fell
asleep
on
the
lobby
floor
, , O
next
to
a
man
wearing
a
Chicago
Cubs
jacket
. . O

I
expected
him
to
say
, , O
`` `` O
I
told
you
so
, , O
'' '' O
but
he
already
was
snoring
. . O

The
journalistic
consensus
was
that
the
earthquake
made
the
World
Series
seem
unimportant
. . O

My
response
was
that
sports
rarely
are
important
, , B
only
diverting
, , O
and
the
quake
merely
highlighted
that
fact
. . O

Should
the
rest
of
the
Series
be
played
at
all
? . O

Sure
. . O

The
quake
and
baseball
were
n
related
, , O
unlike
the
massacre
of
athletes
that
attended
the
1972
Olympics
. . O

That
heavily
politicized
event
learned
nothing
from
the
horrifying
experience
, , O
and
seems
doomed
to
repeat
it
. . O

Two
ironies
intrude
. . O

This
has
been
widely
dubbed
the
BART
Series
, , O
after
the
local
subway
line
, , O
and
the
Bay
Bridge
Series
. . O

Flags
fly
at
half
for
the
death
of
Bart
Giamatti
, , O
the
late
baseball
commissioner
, , O
and
now
the
Bay
Bridge
lies
in
ruins
. . O

A
Series
that
was
shaping
up
as
the
dullest
since
the
one
Detroit
Diego
go
of
1984
has
become
memorable
in
the
least
fortunate
way
. . O

Still
, , O
its
edge
is
lost
. . O

It
now
will
be
played
mostly
for
the
record
, , O
and
should
be
wrapped
up
as
quickly
as
possible
, , O
without
`` `` B
off
'' '' I
days
. . O

And
I
will
never
again
complain
about
a
rainout
. . O

The
disarray
in
the
junk
market
that
began
last
month
with
a
credit
crunch
at
Campeau
Corp
has
offered
commercial
banks
a
golden
opportunity
to
play
a
greater
role
in
financing
billion
takeovers
. . O

But
two
big
New
York
banks
seem
to
have
kicked
those
chances
away
, , O
for
the
moment
, , O
with
the
embarrassing
failure
of
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp
to
deliver
$ $ B
7
billion
in
bank
financing
for
a
leveraged
buy
of
United
Airlines
parent
UAL
Corp
. . O

For
more
than
a
decade
, , O
banks
have
been
pressing
Congress
and
banking
regulators
for
expanded
powers
to
act
like
securities
firms
in
playing
Wall
Street
's
lucrative
takeover
game
, , O
from
giving
mergers
advice
all
the
way
to
selling
and
trading
high
junk
bonds
. . O

Those
expanded
powers
reached
their
zenith
in
July
when
Bankers
Trust
New
York
Corp
provided
mergers
advice
, , O
an
equity
investment
and
bank
loans
for
the
$ $ I
3
billion
leveraged
buy
of
Northwest
Airlines
parent
NWA
Inc
. . O

One
of
the
major
selling
points
used
by
Los
Angeles
financier
Alfred
Checchi
in
getting
the
takeover
approved
was
that
the
deal
did
n
include
any
junk
bonds
. . O

That
was
seen
as
an
advantage
in
lobbying
airline
employees
and
Washington
regulators
for
approval
of
the
contested
takeover
. . O

All
$ $ I
3
billion
in
debt
for
the
deal
was
supplied
by
banks

Davis
on
the

put
both

play
as

candidates
this

says
that
banks
have
been
`` `` O
preparing
to
play
a
larger
and
larger
role
in

financing

'' '' O

Mr
Batchelder
says
that
in
the
past
, , O
banks
would
normally
have
loaned
65
% NN
of
a
total
buy
price
, , O
with
the
loans
secured
by
the
target
company
's
assets

Another
20
% NN
of
the
borrowed
funds
would
come
from
the
sale
to
investors
of
junk
bonds
, , O
which
offer
less
security
and
typically
carry
higher
yields
than
bank
loans

Mr
Checchi
's
purchase
of
NWA
, , O
Mr
Batchelder
notes
, , O
`` `` O
was
probably
the
most
aggressive
to
date

'' '' O
with
bank
debt
at
85
% NN
of
the
purchase
price

But
Mr
Batchelder
says
that
Citicorp
's
`` `` I
failure
to
deliver
'' '' O
on
its
promise
to
raise
the
UAL
bank
debt
for
a
labor
buy
group
`` `` O
is
very
distressing

'' '' O

His
client

Mr

used
just
such
a
letter
from
Citicorp
in
pursuing
UAL
; : O
Citicorp
later
agreed
to
work
with
a
competing
UAL

Executives

the

In
the
wake
of
Campeau
's
problems
, , O
prices
of
junk
bonds
tumbled
, , O
throwing
into
doubt
the
ability

acquirers
to
finance

takeovers

Mark
Solow
, , O
senior
managing

, , O
says
the
falloff
in
junk
bonds
may
yet
open
new
business
opportunities
to
banks
in
structuring
takeovers

But
he
warns
that
banks
will
have
`` `` O
to
have
enough
discipline
'' '' O
not
to
make
loans
that
are
too
risky
. . O

In

Manufacturers
Hanover
said
in
its
third

report
that
fees
from
syndicating
loans
to
other
banks
dropped
48
% NN

to

`` `` O
We

James

Lee
, , O
head
of
syndications

private
placements
at
Chemical
Banking
Corp

said
he
believes
banks
can
still
make
a
credible
offer
of
one
shopping
for
takeover
finance

As
evidence
, , O
he
cites
yesterday

billion
bid
for
American
Medical
International
Inc
in
which
Chemical
served
as
both
the
lead
bank
and
an

investor

Beyond
the
current
weakness
in
the
junk
bond
market
, , O
banks
have
another
advantage
over
investment
banks
in
financing
contested
takeovers

Arthur
Fleischer

a

lawyer
at
Fried
Frank
Harris
Shriver
& CC
Jacobson
, , O
notes
that
`` `` O
a
political
and
emotional
bias
'' '' O
has
developed
against
junk
bonds
. . O

One
hostile
bidder
who
deliberately
avoided
using
junk
bonds
was
Paramount
Communications
Inc
in
its
initial
offer
to
acquire
Time
Inc
for
$ $ B
10
billion
, , O
or
$ $ B
175
a
share
. . O

A
Paramount
spokesman
says
that
decision
was
based
on
the
financial
, , I
not
political
, , I
drawbacks
of
junk
bonds
. . O

But
some
observers
believe
Paramount
Chairman
Martin
Davis
wanted
to
avoid
the
possible
taint
of
being
perceived
as
a
corporate
raider
in
his
controversial
bid
for
Time
. . O

In
the
end
, , O
Mr
Davis
used
junk
bonds
so
that
he
could
raise
Paramount
's
bid
to
$ $ B
200
a
share
. . O

Some
Monday
quarterbacks
said
the
initial
lower
bid
, , O
without
junk
bonds
, , O
was
a
factor
in
his
losing
the
company

Time
eluded
Paramount
by
acquiring
Warner
Communications
Inc

The
success
of
the
NWA
financing
, , O
and
the
failure
of
the
UAL
deal
, , O
also
seem
to
highlight
the
important
new
role
in
takeover
financing
being
played
by
Japanese
banks
. . O

Japanese
banks
accounted
for
50
% NN
of
the
NWA
bank
debt
, , O
according
to
a
report
by
Transportation
Secretary
Samuel
Skinner
. . O

But
it
was
broad
rejection
by
Japanese
banks
that
helped
seal
the
fate
of
the
attempt
to
buy
UAL

Citicorp

The

When

the

Investors

That

crucial

the

Last
Friday

`` `` B

tremors

coursed

increased
the

Lack
of

information
can
cause
fear

Fear
is
the
father

Panic
frequently
results
in
irrational
behavior

And
in
financial
markets
, , O
irrational
behavior
is
sometimes
translated
into
catastrophe

When

many
investors
-- : O

the
very
ones
whose
buying
power
could
restore
stability

are
forced
to
stand
on

To
add

a

a

attribute

the

what

commitments

result

volatility

forgotten
-- : O
and
some
younger
ones
may
never
have
experienced
-- : O
what
it
's
like
to
invest
during
a
recession
. . O

Different
tactics
are
called
for
, , O
as
losing
money
becomes
easier
and
making
money
becomes
tougher
. . O

For
those
investors
who
believe
-- : O
or
fear
-- : O
that
1990
will
be
a
recession
year
, , O
many
economists
and
money
managers
agree
on
steps
that
can
be
taken
to
lower
the
risks
in
a
portfolio
. . O

In
a
nutshell
, , O
pros
advise
investors
who
expect
a
slowdown
to
hold
fewer
stocks
than
usual
and
to
favor
shares
of
big
companies
in
`` `` B
defensive
'' '' I
industries
. . O

A
heavy
dose
of
cash
is
prescribed
, , O
along
with
a
heavier
allotment
to
bonds
-- : O
preferably
government
bonds
. . O

It
's
tempting
to
think
these
defensive
steps
can
be
delayed
until
a
recession
is
clearly
at
hand
. . O

But
that
may
not
be
possible
, , O
because
recessions
often
take
investors
by
surprise
. . O

`` `` O
They
always
seem
to
come
a
bit
later
than
you
expect
. . O

When
they
do
hit
, , O
they
hit
fast
, , O
'' '' O
says
David
A
Wyss
, , O
chief
financial
economist
at
the
Data
Resources
division
of
McGraw
Inc
. . O

Though
he
himself
does
n
expect
a
recession
soon
, , O
Mr
Wyss
advises
people
who
do
that
`` `` O
the
best
thing
to
be
in
is
long
that
is
, , B
20
to
30
Treasury
bonds
. . O
'' '' O

The
reason
is
simple
, , O
Mr
Wyss
says
: : O
`` `` O
Interest
rates
almost
always
decline
during
recession
. . O
'' '' O

As
surely
as
a
seesaw
tilts
, , O
falling
interest
rates
force
up
the
price
of
previously
issued
bonds
. . O

They
are
worth
more
because
they
pay
higher
interest
than
newly
issued
bonds
do
. . O

That
effect
holds
true
for
both
short
and
long
bonds
. . O

But
short
bonds
ca
n
rise
too
much
, , O
because
everyone
knows
they
will
be
redeemed
at
a
preset
price
fairly
soon
. . O

Long
bonds
, , O
with
many
years
left
before
maturity
, , O
swing
more
widely
in
price
. . O

But
not
just
any
bonds
will
do
. . O

Corporate
bonds
`` `` O
are
usually
not
a
good
bet
in
a
recession
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Wyss
says
. . O

As
times
get
tougher
, , O
investors
fret
about
whether
companies
will
have
enough
money
to
pay
their
debts
. . O

This
hurts
the
price
of
corporate
bonds
. . O

Also
, , O
he
notes
, , O
`` `` O
most
corporate
bonds
are
callable
. . O
'' '' O

That
means
that
a
corporation
, , O
after
a
specified
amount
of
time
has
passed
, , O
can
buy
back
its
bonds
by
paying
investors
the
face
value
-LRB
plus
, , O
in
some
cases
, , O
a
sweetener
-RRB
. . O

When
interest
rates
have
dropped
, , O
it
makes
sense
for
corporations
to
do
just
that
; : O
they
then
save
on
interest
costs
. . O

But
the
investors
are
left
stranded
with
money
to
reinvest
at
a
time
when
interest
rates
are
puny
. . O

If
corporate
bonds
are
bad
in
recessions
, , O
junk
bonds
are
likely
to
be
the
worst
of
all
. . O

It
's
an
`` `` I
absolute
necessity
'' '' O
to
get
out
of
junk
bonds
when
a
recession
is
in
the
offing
, , O
says
Avner
Arbel
, , O
professor
of
finance
at
Cornell
University
. . O

`` `` O
Such
bonds
are
very
sensitive
to
the
downside
, , O
and
this
could
be
a
disaster
. . O
'' '' O

Municipal
bonds
are
generally
a
bit
safer
than
corporate
bonds
in
a
recession
, , O
but
not
as
safe
as
bonds
issued
by
the
federal
government
. . O

During
an
economic
slump
, , O
local
tax
revenues
often
go
down
, , O
raising
the
risks
associated
with
at
least
some
municipals
. . O

And
, , O
like
corporates
, , O
many
municipal
bonds
are
callable
. . O

But
a
few
experts
, , O
going
against
the
consensus
, , O
do
n
think
bonds
would
help
investors
even
if
a
recession
is
in
the
offing
. . O

One
of
these
is
Jeffrey
L
Beach
, , O
director
of
research
for
Underwood
Neuhaus
& CC
Co
, , O
a
brokerage
house
in
Houston
, , O
who
thinks
that
`` `` O
we
're
either
in
a
recession
or
about
to
go
into
one
. . O
'' '' O

What
's
more
, , O
he
thinks
this
could
be
a
nastier
recession
than
usual
: : O
`` `` O
Once
the
downturn
comes
, , O
it
's
going
to
be
very
hard
to
reverse
. . O
'' '' O

Investors
, , O
he
advises
, , O
`` `` O
should
be
cautious
, , O
'' '' O
holding
fewer
stocks
than
usual
and
also
shunning
bonds
. . O

Because
he
sees
a
`` `` I
5
% NN
to
6
% NN
base
rate
of
inflation
in
the
economy
, , O
'' '' O
he
doubts
that
interest
rates
will
fall
much
any
time
soon
. . O

Instead
, , O
Mr
Beach
says
, , O
investors
`` `` O
probably
should
be
carrying
a
very
high
level
of
cash
, , O
'' '' O
by
which
he
means
such
so
cash
equivalents
as
money
funds
and
Treasury
bills
. . O

Greg
Confair
, , O
president
of
Sigma
Financial
Inc
in
Allentown
, , O
Pa
, , O
also
recommends
that
investors
go
heavily
for
cash
. . O

He
is
n
sure
a
recession
is
coming
, , O
but
says
the
other
likely
alternative
-- : O
reignited
inflation
-- : O
is
just
as
bad
. . O

`` `` O
This
late
in
an
expansion
, , O
'' '' O
the
economy
tends
to
veer
off
either
into
damaging
inflation
or
into
a
recession
, , O
Mr
Confair
says
. . O

The
Federal
Reserve
Board
's
plan
for
a
`` `` I
soft
landing
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
, , O
requires
the
Fed
to
navigate
`` `` O
an
ever
corridor
. . O
'' '' O

A
soft
landing
is
n
something
that
can
be
achieved
once
and
for
all
, , O
Mr
Confair
adds
. . O

It
has
to
be
engineered
over
and
over
again
, , O
month
after
month
. . O

He
believes
that
the
task
facing
Fed
Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
is
so
difficult
that
it
resembles
`` `` O
juggling
a
double
ax
and
a
buzz
saw
. . O
'' '' O

And
, , O
in
a
sense
, , O
that
's
the
kind
of
task
individuals
face
in
deciding
what
to
do
about
stocks
-- : O
the
mainstay
of
most
serious
investors
' POS
portfolios
. . O

It
comes
down
to
a
question
of
whether
to
try
to
`` `` I
time
'' '' O
the
market
. . O

For
people
who
can
ride
out
market
waves
through
good
times
and
bad
, , O
stocks
have
been
rewarding
long
investments
. . O

Most
studies
show
that
buy
investors
historically
have
earned
an
annual
return
from
stocks
of
9
% NN
to
10
% NN
, , O
including
both
dividends
and
price
appreciation
. . O

That
's
well
above
what
bonds
or
bank
certificates
have
paid
. . O

Moreover
, , O
because
no
one
knows
for
sure
just
when
a
recession
is
coming
, , O
some
analysts
think
investors
should
n
even
worry
too
much
about
timing
. . O

`` `` O
Trying
to
time
the
economy
is
a
mistake
, , O
'' '' O
says
David
Katz
, , O
chief
investment
officer
of
Value
Matrix
Management
Inc
in
New
York
. . O

Mr
Katz
notes
that
some
economists
have
been
predicting
a
recession
for
at
least
two
years
. . O

Investors
who
listened
, , O
and
lightened
up
on
stocks
, , O
`` `` O
have
just
hurt
themselves
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
. . O

Mr
Katz
adds
that
people
who
jump
in
and
out
of
the
stock
market
need
to
be
right
about
70
% NN
of
the
time
to
beat
a
buy
strategy
. . O

Frequent
trading
runs
up
high
commission
costs
. . O

And
the
in
might
miss
the
sudden
spurts
that
account
for
much
of
the
stock
market
's
gains
over
time
. . O

Still
, , O
few
investors
are
able
to
sit
tight
when
they
are
convinced
a
recession
is
coming
. . O

After
all
, , O
in
all
five
recessions
since
1960
, , O
stocks
declined
. . O

According
to
Ned
Davis
, , O
president
of
Ned
Davis
Research
Inc
in
Nokomis
, , O
Fla
, , O
the
average
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
was
about
21
% NN
, , O
and
the
decrease
began
an
average
of
six
months
before
a
recession
officially
started
. . O

By
the
time
a
recession
is
`` `` O
official
'' '' O
-LRB
two
consecutive
quarters
of
declining
gross
national
product
-RRB
, , O
much
of
the
damage
to
stocks
has
already
been
done
- : O
and
, , O
in
the
typical
case
, , O
the
recession
is
already
half
over
. . O

About
six
months
before
a
recession
ends
, , O
stocks
typically
begin
to
rise
again
, , O
as
investors
anticipate
a
recovery
. . O

The
average
recession
lasts
about
a
year
. . O

Unfortunately
, , O
though
, , O
recessions
vary
enough
in
length
so
that
the
average
ca
n
reliably
be
used
to
guide
investors
in
timing
stock
sales
or
purchases
. . O

But
whatever
their
advice
about
timing
, , O
none
of
these
experts
recommend
jettisoning
stocks
entirely
during
a
recession
. . O

For
the
portion
of
an
investor
's
portfolio
that
stays
in
stocks
, , O
professionals
have
a
number
of
suggestions
. . O

Mr
Katz
advocates
issues
with
low
price
ratios
-- : O
that
is
, , O
low
prices
in
relation
to
the
company
's
earnings
per
share
. . O

`` `` B
Low
P
'' '' I
stocks
, , O
he
says
, , O
vastly
outperform
others
`` `` O
during
a
recession
or
bear
market
. . O
'' '' O

In
good
times
, , O
he
says
, , O
they
lag
a
bit
, , O
but
overall
they
provide
superior
performance
. . O

Prof
Arbel
urges
investors
to
discard
stocks
in
small
companies
. . O

Small
shares
typically
fall
more
than
big
stocks
in
a
recession
, , O
he
says
. . O

And
in
any
case
, , O
he
argues
, , O
stocks
of
small
companies
are
`` `` O
almost
as
overpriced
as
they
were
Sept
30
, , I
1987
, , O
just
before
the
crash
. . O
'' '' O

For
example
, , O
Mr
Arbel
says
, , O
stocks
of
small
companies
are
selling
for
about
19
times
cash
flow
. . O

-LRB
Cash
flow
, , O
basically
earnings
plus
depreciation
, , O
is
one
common
gauge
of
a
company
's
financial
health
. . O
-RRB

That
ratio
is
dangerously
close
to
the
ratio
of
19
that
prevailed
before
the
1987
stock
crash
, , O
Mr
Arbel
says
. . O

And
it
's
way
above
the
ratio
-LRB
7
times
cash
flow
-RRB
that
bigger
companies
are
selling
for
. . O

Another
major
trick
in
making
a
portfolio
recession
is
choosing
stocks
in
`` `` B
defensive
'' '' I
industries
. . O

Food
, , I
tobacco
, , I
drugs
and
utilities
are
the
classic
examples
. . O

Recession
or
not
, , O
people
still
eat
, , O
smoke
, , O
and
take
medicine
when
they
're
sick
. . O

George
Putnam
III
, , O
editor
of
Turnaround
Letter
in
Boston
, , O
offers
one
final
tip
for
recession
investors
. . O

`` `` O
Keep
some
money
available
for
opportunities
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
. . O

`` `` O
If
the
recession
does
hit
, , O
there
will
be
some
great
investment
opportunities
just
when
things
seem
the
blackest

'' '' O

Mr
Dorfman
covers

issues
from
The

Street

bureau

Some
industry
groups
consistently
weather
the
storm
better
than

The

outperformed
the
Standard

Index

Bond

posted
strong
gains
as

on
a
bargain
hunt

But
while
the
overall
market
improved
, , O
the
new
junk
market
continued
to
count
casualties

even

prices
rose

Yesterday

The
issue
by
Chicago

North
Western
is
one
of
the
so
good
junk
offerings
on
the
new
calendar

Some
analysts
said
the
restructuring
of
the

shows
how
tough
it
is
for

sell
even
the

Since

it

To

the
Chicago

portfolio
managers

sweetened
the

kicker

The

are
expected
to
have

Donaldson

declined
to
comment
on
the
restructuring

According
to
some
analysts
familiar
with
the
negotiations
, , O
the
10
% NN
of
equity
would
come
directly
from
Donaldson
Lufkin
and
a

affiliated
with
the
investment
bank
Blackstone
Group
, , O
which
would
reduce
their

THE
PANHANDLER
approaches
, , O
makes
his
pitch
. . O

It
may
be
straightforward
-- : O
he
wants
money
for
food
-- : O
or
incredibly
convoluted
; : O
his
sister
is
at
this
very
moment
near
death
in
Hoboken
, , O
he
has
lost
his
wallet
and
has
only
$ $ I
1
in
change
to
put
toward
a
bus
ticket
costing
$ $ B
3
, , O
and
wo
n
you
give
him
the
difference
? . O

No
? . O

Well
, , O
how
about
a
loan
, , O
he
'll
take
your
name
and
address
... : O

Figuring
that
their
money
would
more
likely
go
toward
a
bottle
of
Night
Train
Express
, , O
most
people
have
little
trouble
saying
no
to
propositions
like
this
. . O

But
healthy
skepticism
vanishes
when
they
are
solicited
by
an
organized
charity
to
help
fight
cancer
, , O
famine
, , O
child
abuse
, , O
or
what
have
you
. . O

Most
see
little
reason
to
doubt
that
their
cash
will
go
toward
these
noble
goals
. . O

But
will
it
? . O

In
a
distressing
number
of
cases
, , O
no
. . O

In
fact
, , O
the
donors
sometimes
might
be
better
off
giving
the
money
to
the
panhandler
: : O
at
least
he
has
no
overhead
, , O
and
he
might
even
be
telling
the
truth
. . O

Last
year
, , O
more
than
$ $ I
100
billion
was
donated
to
the
nation
's
400
charities
. . O

While
the
vast
bulk
of
it
was
indeed
spent
by
reputable
organizations
on
the
good
works
it
was
raised
for
, , O
it
's
equally
true
that
a
sizable
hunk
was
consumed
in
`` `` O
expenses
'' '' O
claimed
by
other
operators
, , O
including
fraudulent
expenses
. . O

In
many
cases
the
costs
claimed
were
so
high
that
only
a
dribble
of
cash
was
left
for
the
purported
beneficiaries
. . O

It
's
impossible
to
say
exactly
how
much
of
the
total
charity
intake
is
devoured
by
stratospheric
fund
costs
, , O
high
operators
, , O
and
downright
fraud
. . O

But
the
problem
clearly
is
widespread
and
persistent
. . O

State
law
enforcers
can
barely
keep
up
with
charity
scams
, , O
and
reports
from
watchdog
groups
such
as
the
Council
of
Better
Business
Bureaus
are
not
encouraging

The
Philanthropic
Advisory
Service
of
the
BBB
reviews
hundreds
of
new
charities
every
year
, , O
measuring
them
against
minimum
standards
for
accountability
; : O
for
accuracy
and
honesty
in
solicitation
; : B
and
for
percentage
of
funds
actually
going
to
work
for
which
the
charity
was
supposedly
established
. . O

The
Service
figures
at
least
half
of
the
money
taken
in
should
be
spent
on
program
. . O

Roughly
a
third
of
the
charities
reviewed
flunk
the
test
. . O

Which
, , O
it
should
be
added
, , O
does
n
prevent
the
charities
from
raking
in
a
lot
of
money
anyway
. . O

Without
a
microscope
and
a
subpoena
, , O
it
's
often
hard
to
sort
out
worthwhile
causes

ripoffs
if
all
you

to
go
on

the
solicitation
itself

the
charities

Michael
Burns

says
his
concern
has
only
benefited
from
the
publicity
surrounding
the
case

noting
that

have
signed
on
as
clients

were
impressed
with
the
amount
he
raised
for
National
Children
's
. . O

Meanwhile
, , O
a
state
court
judge
has
allowed
the
charity
to
go
on
soliciting
funds
. . O

Enforcers
ca
n
put
charities
out
of
business
simply
because
they
spend
the
lion
's
share
of
their
income
on
fund
raising
. . O

State
laws
previously
used
as
a
yardstick
minimum
percentages
of
income
-- : O
usually
half
-- : O
that
had
to
be
spent
on
the
program
rather
than
overhead
, , O
but
these
have
been
overturned
by
the
U
Supreme
Court
. . O

It
has
ruled
that
such
laws
might
work
to
stifle
fund
raising
, , O
which
would
amount
to
limiting
the
charities
' POS
first
right
to
freedom
of
expression
. . O

This
puts
upon
enforcers
the
burden
of
proving
outright
fraud
or
misrepresentation
, , O
and
such
actions
have
been
brought
against
hundreds
of
charities
recently

The

general
's
office
in

alone
has
put
seven
of
them
out
of

over

past
couple
of
years

the
enforcement
drive
is
continuing
there

In

the

frequently
zero
in

misrepresentations

raisers

British
Airways
PLC
, , O
a
crucial
participant
in
the
proposed
buy
of
UAL
Corp
, , O
washed
its
hands
of
the
current
efforts
to
revive
a
bid
for
the
parent
of
United
Airlines
. . O

Specifically
, , O
the
British
carrier
said
it
currently
has
no
plans
to
participate
in
any
new
offer
for
UAL
. . O

In
addition
, , O
British
Air
officially
withdrew
its
support
for
the
previous
$ $ I
300
bid
in
a
terse
statement
that
said
`` `` O
the
original
deal
is
closed
. . O
'' '' O

Company
officials
said
later
that
British
Airways
believes
its
involvement
in
the
UAL
buy
ended
last
Friday
when
the
buy
group
, , O
which
also
includes
UAL
's
management
and
pilot
union
, , O
failed
to
obtain
financing
for
the
$ $ I
6
billion
transaction
. . O

The
carrier
stopped
short
of
saying
it
would
n
at
some
point
reconsider
participating
in
any
new
bid
for
UAL
. . O

However
, , O
company
officials
said
they
plan
to
take
`` `` B
no
initiatives
'' '' O
to
resurrect
the
transaction
, , O
and
`` `` O
are
n
aware
'' '' O
of
any
restructured
bid
in
the
making
. . O

Collectively
, , O
the
statements
raised
questions
about
whether
a
new
bid
for
UAL
will
ever
get
off
the
ground
. . O

The
transaction
has
had
a
series
of
setbacks
since
the
financing
problems
became
known
last
Friday
, , O
with
no
signs
or
statements
from
the
buy
group
to
indicate
that
any
progress
has
taken
place
. . O

However
, , O
in
response
to
the
British
Air
decision
, , O
United
's
pilot
union
vowed
to
continue
efforts
to
revive
the
buy
. . O

Pilot
union
Chairman
Frederick
C
Dubinsky
said
advisers
to
UAL
management
and
the
union
will
begin
meeting
in
New
York
today
and
will
work
through
the
weekend
to
devise
a
new
proposal
to
present
to
UAL
's
board
`` `` O
at
the
earliest
time
possible
. . O
'' '' O

Pilot
union
advisers
appeared
confident
that
a
new
bid
could
go
forward
even
without
British
Air
's
participation
. . O

UAL
declined
to
comment
on
British
Air
's
statement
. . O

UAL
Chairman
Stephen
M
Wolf
, , O
who
is
leading
the
management
end
of
the
buy
, , O
has
n
provided
investors
with
any
assurances
about
the
prospect
of
a
new
deal
. . O

In
another
setback
yesterday
, , O
United
's
machinist
union
asked
the
Treasury
Department
to
investigate
whether
certain
aspects
of
the
original
buy
proposal
violated
tax
laws
. . O

In
an
effort
to
derail
the
buy
, , O
the
union
has
already
called
for
investigations
by
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
, , I
Transportation
Department
and
Labor
Department
. . O

But
there
was
one
bright
spot
yesterday
. . O

The
United
flight
union
agreed
to
negotiations
that
could
lead
to
the
flight
attendants
contributing
concessions
to
a
revived
bid
in
exchange
for
an
ownership
stake
. . O

The
pilot
union
, , O
the
only
one
to
support
the
buy
thus
far
, , O
said
the
flight
attendants
' POS
decision
`` `` O
enforces
our
belief
that
an
all
owned
airline
is
practical
and
achievable
. . O
'' '' O

Still
, , O
without
the
assurance
of
British
Airways
' POS
financial
backing
, , O
it
will
be
tougher
for
the
buy
group
to
convince
already
banks
to
make
loan
commitments
for
a
revised
bid
, , O
especially
since
British
Air
's
original
investment
represented
78
% NN
of
the
cash
equity
contribution
for
the
bid
. . O

Under
the
previous
plan
, , O
British
Air
would
have
received
a
15
% NN
stake
in
UAL
in
exchange
for
a
$ $ I
750
million
equity
investment
, , O
with
a
75
% NN
stake
going
to
UAL
employees
and
10
% NN
to
UAL
management
. . O

British
Air
officials
said
the
airline
's
chairman
, , O
Lord
King
, , O
was
concerned
about
news
reports
indicating
that
British
Air
might
be
willing
to
participate
in
a
bid
that
included
a
lower
purchase
price
and
better
investment
terms
for
the
British
carrier
. . O

The
previous
reports
were
based
on
remarks
by
British
Air
's
chief
financial
officer
, , O
Derek
Stevens
, , O
who
said
any
revised
bid
would
have
to
include
a
lower
purchase
price
to
reflect
the
sharp
drop
in
UAL
's
stock
in
the
past
week
. . O

UAL
stock
dropped
$ $ B
1
yesterday
to
$ $ B
190
on
volume
of
923
shares
in
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
. . O

UAL
declined
to
comment
on
British
Air
's
statement
. . O

In
an
interview
Wednesday
with
Dow
Jones
Professional
Investor
Report
, , O
Mr
Stevens
said
, , O
`` `` O
We
're
in
no
way
committed
to
a
deal
going
through
at
all

We
're
not
rushing
into
anything
. . O

We
do

want
to
be
party
to
a
second
rejection

'' '' O

Indeed
, , O
British
Air
seemed
to
be
distancing
itself
from
the
troubled
transaction
early
in
an
effort
to
avoid
any
further
embarrassment
. . O

The
original
transaction
fell
through
on
the
same
day
British
Air
shareholders
approved
the
plan
at
a
special
meeting
after
the
British
succeeded
in
arranging
the
financing
for
its
equity
contribution
. . O

The
carrier
also
seemed
eager
to
place
blame
on
its
American
counterparts
. . O

`` `` O
The
-LCB
buy
-RCB
consortium
ceased
to
exist
because
our
American
partners
were
not
capable
of
organizing
the
financing
, , O
'' '' O
a
British
Air
spokesman
said
. . O

British
Airways
may
have
begun
to
have
second
thoughts
about
the
transaction
after
the
Transportation
Department
forced
Northwest
's
Airlines
' POS
new
owners
to
restructure
the
equity
contribution
of
KLM
Royal
Dutch
Airlines
in
that
carrier
. . O

Most
of
the
department
's
statements
since
the
Northwest
transaction
indicated
it
planned
to
curtail
foreign
ownership
stakes
in
U
carriers
. . O

Even
before
British
Air
's
announcement
, , O
pilot
union
leaders
had
been
meeting
in
Chicago
yesterday
to
consider
their
options
. . O

The
leaders
expressed
support
for
trying
to
revive
the
bid
following
a
briefing
Wednesday
by
the

advisers
, , O
Lazard
Freres

the

chairman

has
led
the

' POS

fight
to
take

UAL
's
advisers
have
indicated
previously
that
it
may
take
a
while
to
come
forward
with
a
revised
plan
since
they
want
to
have
firm
bank
commitments
before
launching
a
new
bid
. . O

They
have
maintained
that
banks
remain
interested
in
financing
the
transaction
. . O

The
buy
fell
through
after
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp
, , O
the
lead
banks
in
the
transaction
, , O
failed
to
obtain

Senate
Democrats
favoring
a
cut
in
the
capital
tax
have
decided
, , O
under
pressure
from
their
leaders
, , O
not
to
offer
their
own
proposal
, , O
placing
another
obstacle
in
the
path
of
President
Bush
's
legislative
priority
. . O

A
core
group
of
six
or
so
Democratic
senators
has
been
working
behind
the
scenes
to
develop
a
proposal
to
reduce
the
tax
on
the
gain
from
the
sale
of
assets
. . O

The
plan
was
complete
except
for
finishing
touches
, , O
and
there
was
talk
that
it
would
be
unveiled
as
early
as
yesterday
. . O

But
Senate
Majority
Leader
George
Mitchell
-LRB
D
, , O
Maine
-RRB
, , O
a
vigorous
opponent
of
the
capital
tax
cut
, , O
called
the
group
to
meet
with
him
Wednesday
night
and
again
yesterday
. . O

Sen
Mitchell
urged
them
to
desist
. . O

Afterward
, , O
leaders
of
the
dissident
Democrats
relented
, , O
and
said
they
would
n
offer
their
own
proposal
as
they
had
planned
. . O

The
decision
is
a
setback
for
President
Bush
, , O
who
needs
the
support
of
Democrats
to
pass
the
tax
cut
through
the
Democratic
Senate
. . O

Having
a
proposal
sponsored
by
Democrats
would
have
given
the
president
an
advantage
. . O

Having
only
a
Republican
measure
makes
the
task
harder
. . O

Still
, , O
Sen
Bob
Packwood
-LRB
R
, , O
Ore
-RRB
, , O
the
lead
sponsor
of
the
Republican
capital
amendment
, , O
predicted
that
the
tax
cut
would
be
enacted
this
year
. . O

He
said
a
clear
majority
of
senators
back
the
tax
reduction
and
that
ultimately
there
would
be
enough
senators
to
overcome
any
procedural
hurdle
the
Democratic
leadership
might
erect
. . O

But
Sen
Mitchell
, , O
buoyed
by
his
victory
among
fellow
Democrats
, , O
strongly
disagreed
. . O

Mr
Mitchell
has
been
predicting
that
the
president
's
initiative
would
fail
this
year
. . O

Yesterday
, , O
in
an
interview
, , O
he
added
that
the
Democrats
' POS
decision
`` `` O
increases
the
likelihood
that
a
capital
tax
cut
will
not
pass
this
year
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Mitchell
's
first
victory
came
last
week
, , O
when
the
Senate
passed
a
deficit
bill
that
did
n
contain
a
capital
provision
. . O

That
vote
made
it
unlikely
that
a
capital
tax
cut
would
be
included
in
the
final
bill
, , O
now
being
drafted
by
House
and
Senate
negotiators
. . O

The
House
version
of
the
bill
does
include
the
tax
cut
. . O

Now
Republican
leaders
are
concentrating
on
attaching
a
capital
amendment
to
some
other
bill
, , O
perhaps
a
measure
raising
the
federal
borrowing
limit
or
a
second
tax
bill
that
would
follow
on
the
heels
of
the
deficit
legislation
. . O

To
help
lay
the
groundwork
for
that
fight
, , O
President
Bush
plans
early
next
week
to
meet
at
the
White
House
with
some
20
Democratic
senators
who
favor
cutting
the
capital
tax
or
are
undecided
on
the
issue
. . O

The
president
apparently
will
have
only
one
bill
to
push
, , O
Sen
Packwood
's
, , O
and
at
least
some
of
the
dissident
Democrats
plan
to
support
it
. . O

`` `` O
I
may
want
to
offer
additional
amendments
to
improve
it
when
the
bill
comes
to
the
floor
, , O
'' '' O
said
Sen
David
Boren
-LRB
D
, , O
Okla
-RRB
, , O
a
leader
of
those
Democrats
. . O

The
Packwood
plan
, , O
as
expected
, , O
would
allow
individuals
to
exclude
from
income
5
% NN
of
the
gain
from
the
sale
of
a
capital
asset
held
for
more
than
one
year
. . O

The
exclusion
would
rise
five
percentage
points
for
each
year
the
asset
was
held
, , O
until
it
reached
a
maximum
of
35
% NN
after
seven
years
. . O

The
exclusion
would
apply
to
assets
sold
after
Oct
1
. . O

As
an
alternative
, , O
taxpayers
could
chose
to
reduce
their
gains
by
an
inflation
index
. . O

For
corporations
, , O
the
top
tax
rate
on
the
sale
of
assets
held
for
more
than
three
years
would
be
cut
to
33
% NN
from
the
current
top
rate
of
34
% NN
. . O

That
rate
would
gradually
decline
to
as
little
as
29
% NN
for
corporate
assets
held
for
15
years
. . O

The
Packwood
plan
also
would
include
a
proposal
, , O
designed
by
Sen
William
Roth
-LRB
R
, , O
Del
-RRB
, , O
that
would
create
new
tax
benefits
for
individual
retirement
accounts
. . O

The
Roth
plan
would
create
a
new
, , I
non
IRA
from
which
money
could
be
withdrawn
tax
not
only
for
retirement
, , O
but
also
for
the
purchase
of
a
first
home
, , O
education
expenses
and
medical
expenses
. . O

Current
IRAs
could
be
rolled
over
into
the

realizing
benefits
of
a
sustained
effort

cut
costs
and
boost
productivity
, , O
reported
sharply
improved
third
results

The
producer
and
marketer
of
low

said
net
income
for
the

was
$ $ B
5
million

on
revenue
of

For
the
year
period

the
company
reported
a
loss
of
$ $ B
520
or
six
cents
a
share
. . O

In
the
latest
nine
months
, , O
the
company
earned

or
$ $ B

Last
year
's
net
loss
of

included
a
benefit
of
$ $ B

an
accounting
change

Revenue
for
the
nine
months
rose
to
$ $ B
449

from
$ $ B
441
million
. . O

In
an
interview
, , O
Pemberton
Hutchinson
, , O
president
and
chief
executive
, , O
cited
several
reasons
for
the
improvement
: : O
higher
employee
productivity
and
`` `` B
good
natural
conditions
'' '' O
in
the
mines
, , O
as
well
as
lower
costs
for
materials
, , O
administrative
overhead
and
debt
interest
. . O

In
the
latest
nine
months
, , O
Mr
Hutchinson
said
, , O
total
coal
sales
rose
to
about
14
million
tons
from
about
14
million
tons
a
year
earlier
. . O

In

long
debt
has
been
trimmed
to
about
$ $ I
72

He
predicted
the
debt
ratio
will
improve
further
in

Westmoreland
's
strategy
is
to
retain
and
expand
its
core
business
of
mining
and
selling
low
coal
in
the
Appalachia
region
. . O

The
operating
territory
includes
coal
terminals
on
the
Ohio
River
and
in
Newport
News
, , O
Va
. . O

Westmoreland
exports
about
a
fourth
of
its
coal
tonnage
, , O
including
a
significant
amount
of
metallurgical
coal
produced
by
others
that
is
used
by
steelmakers
overseas
. . O

For
the
past
couple
of
years
, , O
Westmoreland
has
undertaken
an
aggressive
streamlining
of
all
aspects
of
its
business
. . O

Marginal
operations
and
assets
have
been
sold
. . O

The
size
of
the
company
's
board
has
been
reduced
to
eight
directors
from
13
. . O

About
140
salaried
management
jobs
and
hundreds
of
hourly
wage
positions
have
been
eliminated
. . O

Even
perks
have
been
reduced
. . O

For
example
, , O
the
chief
executive
himself
now
pays
20
% NN
of
the
cost
of
his
health
benefits
; : O
the
company
used
to
pay
100
% NN
. . O

`` `` O
I
think
the
ship
is
now
righted
, , O
the
bilges
are
pumped
and
we
are
on
course
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Hutchinson
said
of
the
restructuring
program
. . O

`` `` O
Much
of
what
we
set
out
to
do
is
completed
. . O
'' '' O

But
he
cautioned
that
Westmoreland
's
third
quarter
is
typically
better
than
the
fourth
, , O
so
investors
`` `` O
should
n
just
multiply
the
third
quarter
by
four
'' '' O
and
assume
the
same
rate
of
improvement
can
be
sustained
. . O

One
difference
, , O
he
said
, , O
is
that
the
fourth
quarter
has
significantly
fewer
workdays
because
of
holidays
and
the
hunting
season
. . O

`` `` O
I
do
n
want
to
give
the
impression
that
everybody
can
relax
now
, , O
'' '' O
he
said
. . O

`` `` O
We
have
to
keep
working
at
improving
our
core
business
to
stay
efficient
. . O

It
's
a
process
that
never
really
ends
. . O
'' '' O

Nevertheless
, , O
Mr
Hutchinson
predicted
that
1989
would
be
`` `` O
solidly
profitable
'' '' O
for
Westmoreland
and
that
1990
would
bring
`` `` O
more
of
the
same
. . O
'' '' O

For
all
of
1988
, , O
the
company
reported
an
after
operating
loss
of
$ $ B
134
on
revenue
of
$ $ B
593
million
. . O

An
accounting
adjustment
made
net
income
$ $ B
1
million
, , O
or
18
cents
a
share
. . O

In
a
move
that
complements
the
company
's
basic
strategy
, , O
its
Westmoreland
Energy
Inc
unit
is
developing
four
coal
cogeneration
plants
with
a
partner
in
Virginia
. . O

Some
of
the
coal
the
plants
buy
will
come
from
Westmoreland
mines
. . O

Mr
Hutchinson
predicted
that
the
unit
's
contribution
to
company
results
in
the
1990s
`` `` O
will
be
exciting
. . O
'' '' O

He
said
Westmoreland
is
looking
at
investment
stakes
in
other
cogeneration
plants
east
of
the
Mississippi
River
. . O

Westmoreland
expects
energy
demand
to
grow
annually
in
the
2
% NN
range
in
the
early
1990s
. . O

`` `` O
We
see
coal
's
piece
of
the
action
growing

'' '' O
Mr
Hutchinson
said

`` `` O

Chase

its

Chase
had
purchased
an

for
an
undisclosed
sum
from
the
late
Sol
Atlas
as

of
its
original
lease
in

The
current
transaction
cost
the

approximately
$ $ I
140
million
. . O

Of
that
amount
, , O
$ $ B
20
million
was
payment
for
the
land
underneath
the

the
rest
was
for
the
building
itself
. . O

The
building
houses
about
4
Chase
workers
, , O
most
of
whom
will
be
moved
to
downtown
Brooklyn
after
the
bank
's
new
back
office
center
is
completed
in
1993

The
move
is
part
of
Chase
's
strategy
to
consolidate
its
back
offices
under
one
roof
. . O

The
headquarters
is
located
a
few
blocks
away
at

Chase
Manhattan
Plaza

As
part
of
its
decision
to
leave
the
building

Chase
tried
to
sell
its

along
with
the
Atlas
estate

interest

shortly
after
the
October
1987
stock
market
crash

Chase
Senior
Vice
President
George
Scandalios
said
the
bank
decided
to
exercise
its
option
after

He
said
Chase

the
Atlas

were
looking
to
sell
the
entire

for

400

to
$ $ I
475

but
did

get
an

As
the

Chase
will
have

cut
out

striking
views

New

the
building
is
considered
antiquated

WALL

SHAKE
hands
with
George
Orwell

The
author
of
the
futuristic
novel
`` `` I

language
called
Newspeak

it

develop

heretical
thought
-- : O
that
is

anything
negative
about
the
policies

Wall

has

that
far

it
has
made
a
promising
start

Its
language
-- : O

it

mellifluous

When

as
a

For

a

These
people
used
to
be
called
brokers

but
apparently
this
word
either
is
not
grandiose
enough
or
carries
too
many
negative
connotations
from
the
aforementioned
technical
correction

when
terrified
customers
could

raise
brokers
on
the
phone

Either
way

the
word
`` `` I

is
clearly
out

Of

a
sense
of

broad
competence

in
selling

It
is
a
competence

When

so
poorly

its
reputation

tarnished

look
for

give

In

For

`` `` B

mutual

do

expect
a
new

And
do

some
of

Larry

manager

Blue

he
says

`` `` O

Finally
, , O
even
the
time
strategy
called
`` `` O
value

no
longer
means
what
it
once
did

Before
the

rooting
out

those
with
shrewd
management

sound
fundamentals
and
decent
prospects

Now
, , O
says
Mr
Biehl

value
investing
often
means
`` `` O
looking
for

To
institutional

When
Walter
Yetnikoff
, , O
the
president
of
Sony
Corp
's
CBS
Records
, , O
last
month
told
producer
Peter
Guber
that
Sony
was
about
to
make
a
$ $ I
3
billion
bid
for
Columbia
Pictures
and
needed
someone
to
run
the
studio
, , O
Mr
Guber
jumped
at
the
chance
. . O

Within
two
days
, , O
he
was
on
his
way
to
New
York
and
Tokyo
to
meet
with
top
brass
at
Sony
. . O

And
before
the
week
was
out
, , O
Sony
had
offered
Mr
Guber
and
his
partner
, , O
Jon
Peters
, , O
the
most
lucrative
employment
contracts
in
the
history
of
the
movie
business
. . O

Not
only
that
, , O
Sony
also
agreed
to
give
them
a
stake
in
Columbia
's
future
profits
and
buy
their
company
, , O
Guber
Peters
Entertainment
Co
, , O
for
$ $ B
200
million
, , O
almost
40
% NN
more
than
the
market
value
of
the
company
. . O

There
was
just
one
sticking
point
: : O
The
two
had
a
prior
commitment
. . O

Just
seven
months
earlier
, , O
they
had
signed
a
five
exclusive
contract
to
make
movies
for
Warner
Bros
for
which
they
had
just
produced
the
smash
hit
`` `` I
Batman
. . O
'' '' O

But
Mr
Guber
figured
that
Warner
Communications
Inc
chairman
Steven
Ross
, , O
would
empathize
and
let
the
producers
go
, , O
knowing
the
Sony
offer
was
`` `` O
the
culmination
of
a
life
's
work
. . O
'' '' O

He
figured
wrong
. . O

Last
week
, , O
following
fruitless
settlement
talks
, , O
Warner
, , O
now
merging
with
Time
Inc
, , O
filed
a
$ $ O
1
billion
breach
of
contract
suit
in
Los
Angeles
Superior
Court
against
both
Sony
and
Guber
Peters
. . O

Sony
promptly
countersued
, , O
charging
Warner
with
trying
to
sabotage
its
acquisitions
and
hurt
its
efforts
to
enter
the
U
movie
business
. . O

The
accusations
of
lying
and
duplicity
are
flying
thick
and
fast
on
both
sides
: : O
As
one
Sony
executive
puts
it
, , O
`` `` O
It
's
World
War
III
. . O
'' '' O

That
two
successful
producers
who
are
n
all
that
well
known
outside
Hollywood
could
occasion
such
a
clash
of
corporate
titans
suggests
how
desperate
the
quest
for
proven
talent
is
in
the
movie
business
. . O

And
they
are
a
very
odd
team
in
any
case
. . O

Mr
Guber
was
raised
in
Boston
and
educated
in
New
York
. . O

He
is
a
lawyer
with
a
string
of
academic
degrees
. . O

Mr
Peters
is
a
high
dropout
who
came
to
fame
as
Barbra
Streisand
's
hairdresser
. . O

Yet
, , O
they
are
far
and
away
the
most
prolific
producers
in
Hollywood
. . O

And
despite
their
share
of
duds
, , O
they
make
movies
that
make
money
. . O

That
is
a
skill
Sony
badly
needs
-- : O
and
Warner
is
loath
to
lose
. . O

Although
Columbia
had
a
good
summer
with
`` `` O
Ghostbusters
II
'' '' O
and
`` `` O
When
Harry
Met
Sally
, , O
'' '' O
rivals
such
as
Warner
, , O
Paramount
Pictures
, , O
Walt
Disney
Co
and
Universal
Studios
have
been
thrashing
Columbia
at
the
box
office
. . O

After
five
years
of
management
turmoil
, , O
with
four
different
studio
heads
, , O
Columbia
sorely
needs
a
stable
, , I
savvy
team
to
restore
its
credibility
and
get
it
back
in
the
business
of
making
hits
. . O

Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
are
n
universally
loved
in
Hollywood
but
they
are
well
connected
. . O

Their
stock
in
trade
as
`` `` B
executive
producers
'' '' O
is
sniffing
out
hot
properties
, , O
locking
them
up
and
then
getting
big
studios
to
bankroll
and
distribute
them
. . O

Sometimes
Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
do
little
more
than
grab
the
first
draft
of
a
screenplay
for
a
`` `` I
Flashdance
, , O
'' '' O
or
buy
rights
to
a
best
seller
such
as
`` `` O
The
Color
Purple
. . O
'' '' O

It
falls
to
others
to
do
the
writing
, , I
directing
and
producing
. . O

With
MGM
's
`` `` I
Rainman
, , O
'' '' O
for
instance
, , O
Messrs
Guber
and
Peters
had
virtually
nothing
to
do
with
day
production
, , O
but
their
names
still
appear
in
big
letters
on
the
credits
, , O
and
they
are
inevitably
associated
with
its
success
. . O

Sometimes
, , O
as
with
`` `` O
Batman
, , O
'' '' O
the
pair
really
do
make
the
film
. . O

In
that
case
, , O
Guber
Peters
acquired
the
rights
in
1979
, , O
nursed
the
movie
through
a
dozen
scripts
, , O
and
were
on
the
set
in
London
for
11
months
hovering
over
the
most
minute
changes
in
casting
and
production
. . O

`` `` O
They
're
the
best
production
talent
around
, , O
'' '' O
says
Brian
De
Palma
, , O
beholden
to
Guber
Peters
for
hiring
him
to
direct
the
Warner
movie
of
Tom
Wolfe
's
novel
`` `` I
Bonfire
of
the
Vanities
. . O
'' '' O

On
that
film
, , O
which
is
to
start
shooting
in
a
few
months
, , O
`` `` O
they
've
been
very
much
involved
, , O
hiring
talent
and
discussing
the
development
of
the
script
. . O

And
when
you
're
making
a
movie
this
big
, , O
you
need
all
the
help
you
can
get
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
De
Palma
adds
. . O

`` `` O
I
wish
they
were
around
24
hours
a
day
. . O
'' '' O

And
some
movies
seem
to
have
been
hurt
by
their
inattention
. . O

Warner
executives
blame
Mr
Guber
's
and
Mr
Peters
's
lack
of
involvement
in
`` `` O
Caddyshack
II
'' '' O
for
casting
and
production
problems
and
the
film
's
ultimate
dismal
failure
. . O

`` `` O
We
've
had
a
few
bombs
, , O
'' '' O
admits
Mr
Peters
. . O

`` `` O
But
by
and
large
this
company
has
only
been
profitable
. . O
'' '' O

He
says
his
company
's
prowess
at
packaging
and
marketing
`` `` O
is
why
we
'll
be
good
at
Columbia
. . O

We
practically
ran
our
own
studio
. . O
'' '' O

Longtime
Hollywood
associates
describe
Mr
Guber
as
the
intellectual
powerhouse
of
the
two
, , O
a
man
with
a
flair
for
deal
and
marketing
. . O

`` `` O
Peter
is
a
major
piece
of
Hollywood
manpower

has
really
earned
his
success

to
develop
such

material

'' '' O

Mr
Peters
, , O
on
the
other
hand

has
fewer
fans
in
Hollywood
, , O
and
his
detractors
like
to
characterize
him
as
something
of
a
hot
bully

He
gets
better
reviews
as
a
creative
whiz

an
enthusiast
, , O
an
idea
man

He
also
had
to
fight
harder
for
credibility

his
partner
did

Barbra
Streisand
made
him
famous

He
cut
her
hair

He
lived

He
came
to

movies

`` `` O
A
Star
Is
Born
'' '' O
and
`` `` O
The
Main
Event

'' '' O

Thrice
married

now
single

Mr
Peters
got
plenty
of
ink
last
summer
for
an
on
romance
with
actress
Kim
Basinger
during
the
making
of
`` `` O
Batman

'' '' O

Mr
Guber
, , O
by
contrast
, , O
has
been
married
to
one
woman
for
more
than
20
years
. . O

But
for
all
their
intellectual
and
stylistic
differences

they
make
the
perfect
`` `` I
good
cop

cop

`` `` O

'' '' O

Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
rub
many
people
in
Hollywood
the
wrong
way

Producers
Don
Simpson

Jerry
Bruckheimer

who
shepherded
`` `` O

'' '' O
through
several
scripts
and
ultimately
produced
the
movie

bristle
when
Messrs

take
credit
for
the
film

Says
Mr
Simpson
: : O
`` `` O
The
script

unreadable

We
reinvented
it

When
Roger
Birnbaum

an
executive
who
worked
for
Guber
Peters

early
1980s
, , O
left
to
take
a
job

of
production

films

had
helped
develop
, , O
including
`` `` O

'' '' O
and

Mr
Peters
acknowledges
that
and
says
it
's
not
unlike
the
situation
he
and
Mr
Guber
are
in
with
Warner
. . O

`` `` O
I
was
upset
with
Roger

I
fumpered

schmumpered

Mr
Peters

`` `` O
But
he
wanted

pursue

'' '' O

Still

Mr

his
relationship
with
Guber
Peters
was
`` `` O
one

'' '' O

The
two

'' '' O

Mr
Birnbaum
recalls
that
Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
shifted
into
high
gear
a
few
years
back
upon
learning
that
they
had
competition
for
the
story
of
the
murdered
naturalist
Dian
Fossey
, , O
which
became
`` `` O
Gorillas
in
the
Mist
. . O
'' '' O

He
says
, , O
`` `` O
Within
a
few
weeks
, , O
we
made
deals
with
the
government
of
Rwanda
and
everyone
who
had
ever
met
or
talked
to
Dian
Fossey
. . O

I
think
Peter
even
made
some
deals
with
the
gorillas

'' '' O

Universal
Studios
was
working
on
a
competing
film
, , O
but
the
studio
and
its
producers
ultimately
agreed
to
co
the
film
with
Guber
Peters
and
Warner
. . O

More
recently
, , O
Guber
Peters
beat
out
a
dozen
other
producers
, , O
reportedly
including
Robert
Redford
and
Ted
Turner
, , O
for
rights
to
the
life
story
of
Chico
Mendes
, , O
the
murdered
Brazilian
union
leader
who
fought
developers
in
the
Amazon
rain
forest
. . O

Messrs
Guber
and
Peters
assiduously
courted
the
man
's
widow
for
months
, , O
showing
her
a
tape
of
`` `` O
Gorillas
in
the
Mist
'' '' O
to
impress
her
with
the
quality
of
their
work
. . O

Money
helped
, , O
too
. . O

Ultimately
, , O
they
paid
more
than
$ $ I
1
million
for
the
rights
. . O

-LRB
The
sale
caused
a
rift
between
the
widow
and
some
of
her
husband
's
followers
. . O

Some
of
the
money
will
go
to
the
Chico
Mendes
Foundation
, , O
but
it
is
n
earmarked
for
groups
trying
to
save
the
rain
forest
. . O
-RRB

It
's
hardly
astonishing
-LRB
given
the
men
's
track
record
-RRB
that
Sony
wants
Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
. . O

But
it
is
puzzling
to
some
Hollywood
executives
that
Sony
rushed
to
hire
them
without
clearing
up
the
Warner
situation
first
. . O

Some
note
that
Sony
might
have
saved
itself
some
trouble
by
just
hiring
Mr
Guber
and
letting
Mr
Peters
stay
on
to
fulfill
the
Warner
contract
. . O

But
though
`` `` O
people
in
town
may
ask
why
Guber
needs
Peters
, , O
it
's
good
to
have
a
partner
, , O
and
obviously
the
chemistry
works
, , O
'' '' O
says
Steven
Tisch
, , O
a
producer
who
once
worked
for
Mr
Guber
. . O

`` `` O
This
business
is
n
about
personalities

end

it

In

case

the

Mr
Guber
got
his
start
in
the
movie
business
at
Columbia
two
decades
ago

Recruited
from
New

University

MBA
program

he
rose
within
two
years

`` `` O

Guber
Peters
produced
a
number
of
hits
for
Warner
and
others
, , O
their
record
was
n
always
so
impressive
. . O

Among
their
clinkers
were
`` `` O
The
Legend
of
Billie
Jean
, , O
'' '' O
`` `` O
VisionQuest
, , O
'' '' O
`` `` O
Clue
'' '' O
and
`` `` O
Clan
of
the
Cave
Bear
. . O
'' '' O

And
the
failures
make
it
possible
for
Warner
in
its
current
lawsuit
to
paint
the
producers
as
ingrates
. . O

The
studio
says
it
stuck
with
them
`` `` O
even
in
the
early
years
when
the
creative
partnership
was
not
particularly
profitable
for
Warner
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Guber
replies
that
`` `` O
this
is
a
Goliath
, , O
this
Time
Warner
, , O
trying
to
chew
up
two
fellows
who
have
done
only
well
for
them
for
a
long
period
of
time
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
maintain
that
executives
at
Warner
have
always
known
of
their
ambitions
to
run
a
major
entertainment
powerhouse
, , O
but
that
Warner
never
felt
threatened
until
they
linked
up
with
Sony
. . O

`` `` O
From
the
beginning
, , O
-LCB
they
-RCB
knew
we
had
a
goal
and
a
dream
, , O
'' '' O
says
Mr
Guber
. . O

On
a
number
of
occasions
, , O
he
adds
, , O
he
tried
to
get
Warner
to
buy
Guber
Peters
outright
. . O

`` `` O
They
always
listened
, , O
but
they
never
acted
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Guber
says
. . O

In
1987
, , O
Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
contributed
their
company
's
assets
in
exchange
for
a
28
% NN
stake
in
Barris
Entertainment
, , O
a
small
TV
production
company
controlled
by
Giant
Industries
Inc
Chairman
Burt
Sugarman
. . O

In
July
a
year
later
, , O
Warner
agreed
to
release
the
producers
from
their
old
contract
when
Messrs
Guber
, , I
Peters
and
Sugarman
made
a
$ $ I
100
million
offer
to
buy
25
% NN
of
MGM
. . O

Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
planned
to
run
the
nearly
dormant
MGM
studio
, , O
and
the
two
even
tried
to
interest
Warner
Bros
. . O
' '' O
President
Terry
Semel
in
becoming
a
partner
after
he
advised
them
on
the
deal
. . O

But
the
MGM
plan
collapsed
just
two
weeks
later
. . O

Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
say
they
got
a
look
at
the
books
and
balked
at
the
price
. . O

Their
relationship
with
Mr
Sugarman
soured
shortly
thereafter
. . O

Last
May
, , O
he
sold
his
24
% NN
stake
in
Barris
to
a
passive
Australian
investor
and
Barris
was
renamed
Guber
Peters
Entertainment
Co
. . O

Meanwhile
, , O
Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
had
agreed
to
extend
their
Warner
agreement
with
the
new
five
exclusive
contract
. . O

The
new
deal
was
considered
the
most
generous
of
its
kind
, , O
both
financially
and
in
terms
of
creative
freedom
. . O

But
it
paled
by
comparison
to
what
Sony
was
to
offer
last
month
: : O
the
chance
, , O
at
last
, , O
to
run
a
major
studio
, , O
about
$ $ I
50
million
in
deferred
compensation
, , O
up
to
10
% NN
of
Columbia
's
future
cash
flow
, , O
8
% NN
of
the
future
appreciation
of
Columbia
's
market
value
, , O
and
annual
salaries
of
$ $ B
2
million
for
each
. . O

The
producers
' POS
28
% NN
share
of
publicly
held
Guber
Peters
would
net
them
an
additional
$ $ I
50
million
. . O

Sony
also
agreed
to
indemnify
the
producers
against
any
liability
to
Warner
. . O

Sony
is
paying
a
hefty
price
for
a
company
that
had
revenue
of
only
$ $ I
42
million
last
year
. . O

And
earnings
have
been
erratic
. . O

In
the
the
latest
quarter
, , O
thanks
in
part
to
`` `` O
Batman
, , O
'' '' O
Guber
Peters
earned
$ $ B
5
million
, , O
or
50
cents
a
share
, , O
compared
to
a
loss
of
$ $ B
6
million
, , O
or
62
cents
a
share
, , O
in
last
year
's
quarter
. . O

Guber
Peters
stock
, , O
which
traded
as
low
as
$ $ B
6
a
share
last
year
, , O
closed
yesterday
at
$ $ B
16
. . O

The
two
sides
now
are
accusing
each
other
of
lying
. . O

Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
claim
they
have
an
oral
agreement
with
Warner
executives
that
allows
them
to
terminate
their
contract
should
the
opportunity
to
run
a
major
studio
arise
. . O

But
in
affidavits
filed
yesterday
in
the
Los
Angeles
court
, , O
Mr
Ross
, , O
Warner
Bros
Chairman
Robert
Daly
and
President
Semel
deny
that
such
an
oral
agreement
was
ever
made
. . O

Warner
, , O
in
its
court
filings
, , O
calls
it
`` `` O
a
piece
of
fiction
created
for
this
litigation
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Daly
in
his
affidavit
acknowledges
that
Warner
agreed
to
release
the
producers
last
year
to
take
over
MGM
but
says
that
situation
was
altogether
different
. . O

For
one
thing
, , O
according
to
Mr
Daly
, , O
the
producers
requested
a
release
in
advance
. . O

Moreover
, , O
the
old
contract
was
about
to
expire
, , O
and
the
lineup
of
Guber
Peters
pictures
for
Warner
was
n
as
strong
as
it
is
now
. . O

Warner
itself
was
in
negotiations
with
MGM
over
certain
movie
and
other
rights
, , O
and
it
was
`` `` O
in
Warner
's
interest
to
accommodate
MGM
, , I
Guber
and
Peters
by
permitting
them
to
become
MGM
executives
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Daly
said
in
his
affidavit
. . O

Warner
obviously
does
n
think
that
it
is
in
its
own
interests
to
let
Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
go
off
to
Columbia
. . O

At
the
very
least
, , O
Mr
Ross
clearly
sees
an
opportunity
to
use
the
two
men
to
get
a
pound
of
flesh
from
Sony
. . O

During
settlement
talks
, , O
for
example
, , O
Warner
demanded
such
things
as
cable
TV
rights
to
Columbia
movies
and
Columbia
's
interest
in
the
studio
it
jointly
owns
with
Warner
, , O
according
to
executives
involved
in
the
talks
. . O

In
any
settlement
, , O
Warner
is
almost
certain
to
demand
rights
to
most
of
the
50
or
so
projects
Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
have
locked
up
for
the
next
few
years
, , O
notably
sequels
to
`` `` O
Batman
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Guber
and
Mr
Peters
refuse
to
concede
that
they
may
have
made
a
tactical
error
in
accepting
the
Sony
offer
before
taking
it
up
with
Warner
. . O

And
they
say
there
are
plenty
of
precedents
in
Hollywood
for
letting
people
out
of
contracts
. . O

The
last
time
Columbia
Pictures
was
looking
for
a
studio
chief
, , O
they
note
, , O
Warner
released
producer
David
Puttnam
from
his
contract
, , O
then
took
him
back
after
he
was
subsequently
fired
by
his
bosses
at
Columbia
. . O

In
his
affidavit
filed
yesterday
, , O
Warner
's
Mr
Ross
indicated
he
is
n
buying
any
such
argument
: : O
`` `` O
If
Sony
succeeds
here
, , O
no
written
contract
in
Hollywood
will
be
worth
the
paper
it
's
written
on
. . O

THE
SALES
PITCH
could
n
sound
better
. . O

First
, , O
there
's
the
name
: : O
`` `` O
asset
securities
. . O
'' '' O

Better
than
all
those
offers
you
get
to
buy
securities
backed
by
nothing
. . O

And
there
's
more
. . O

The
assets
backing
the
securities
come
from
some
of
the
country
's
biggest
-- : O
and
most
secure
-- : O
institutions
. . O

Most
earn
high
ratings
from
credit
agencies
. . O

Their
yields
are
higher
than
those
of
U
Treasury
issues
. . O

And
the
booming
market
has
already
attracted
many
of
the
nation
's
biggest
institutional
investors
. . O

Ready
to
jump
? . O

Well
, , O
think
twice
. . O

The
concept
may
be
simple
: : O
Take
a
bunch
of
loans
, , O
tie
them
up
in
one
neat
package
, , O
and
sell
pieces
of
the
package
to
investors
. . O

But
the
simplicity
may
be
misleading
. . O

Skeptics
say
the
slightly
higher
returns
are
n
enough
to
compensate
for
the
extra
risk
. . O

They
warn
that
asset
securities
are
only
as
good
as
the
assets
and
credit
backing
that
support
them
-- : O
and
those
are
hard
to
evaluate
. . O

Moreover
, , O
the
securities
were
introduced
only
about
4
1
years
ago
; : O
the
biggest
unknown
is
how
they
will
fare
in
a
recession
. . O

`` `` O
A
lot
of
this
stuff
really
is
in
untested
waters
, , O
'' '' O
says
Owen
Carney
, , O
director
of
the
investment
securities
division
of
the
U
comptroller
of
the
currency
. . O

`` `` O
We
do
n
know
how
this
whole
market
will
work
in
a
serious
economic
downturn
. . O
'' '' O

Such
concerns
, , O
however
, , O
have
n
stopped
asset
securities
from
becoming
one
of
Wall
Street
's
hottest
new
products
. . O

Since
the
spring
of
1985
, , O
financial
alchemists
have
transformed
a
wide
variety
of
debt
into
these
new
securities
. . O

They
have
sold
issues
backed
by
car
loans
, , O
boat
loans
and
recreational
loans
. . O

They
have
offered
bundles
of
homeequity
loans
, , O
as
well
as
packages
of
loans
used
to
buy
vacation
time
. . O

Last
year
, , O
there
was
an
issue
of
`` `` O
death
bonds
'' '' O
-- : O
securities
backed
by
loans
to
life
policyholders
. . O

Some
predict
there
will
be
`` `` O
Third
World
bonds
, , O
'' '' O
backed
by
loans
to
Brazil
, , O
Argentina
and
other
debt
nations
. . O

And
the
biggest
volume
this
year
has
been
on
securities
backed
by
credit
receivables
, , O
sometimes
known
as
`` `` O
plastic
bonds
. . O
'' '' O

`` `` O
This
is
the
heyday
of
debt
, , O
'' '' O
says
James
Grant
, , O
editor
of
Grant
's
Interest
Rate
Observer
, , O
a
newsletter
. . O

`` `` O
Before
the
sun
sets
on
the
'80s
, , O
it
seems
nothing
will
be
left
unhocked
. . O
'' '' O

The
result
is
a
$ $ I
45
billion
market
, , O
according
to
Securities
Data
Co
. . O

That
includes
more
than
$ $ I
9
billion
issued
through
August
of
this
year
, , O
up
sharply
from
$ $ B
6
billion
in
the
comparable
1988
period
-- : B
and
more
than
in
all
of
1987
. . O

Most
issues
have
been
sold
to
professional
money
managers
, , O
pension
funds
, , O
bank
trust
departments
and
other
institutions
. . O

But
wealthy
individuals
also
have
been
jumping
in
, , O
and
lately
brokers
have
been
pushing
smaller
investors
into
the
asset
market
. . O

The
entry
fee
is
affordable
: : O
Issues
typically
are
sold
in
minimum
denominations
of
$ $ B
1
. . O

`` `` O
We
expect
additional
offerings
'' '' O
of
asset
securities
targeted
toward
individual
investors
, , O
says
Bill
Addiss
, , O
a
senior
vice
president
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc
. . O

The
process
typically
begins
when
an
institution
, , O
such
as
Citibank
or
Sears
, , I
Roebuck
& CC
Co
, , O
takes
a
pool
of
credit
or
other
receivables
and
sells
them
to
a
specially
created
trust
. . O

The
trust
then
issues
securities
-- : O
generally
due
in
five
years
or
less
-- : O
that
are
underwritten
by
Wall
Street
brokerage
firms
and
offered
to
investors
. . O

Issues
typically
come
with
`` `` O
credit
enhancements
, , O
'' '' O
such
as
a
bank
letter
of
credit
, , O
and
thus
have
received
high
credit
ratings
. . O

Enthusiasts
say
the
booming
market
has
opened
up
a
valuable
new
source
of
funds
to
issuers
, , O
while
providing
a
valuable
new
investment
for
individuals
and
institutions
. . O

Asset
securities
`` `` O
are
an
attractive
investment
compared
to
bank
certificates
of
deposit
or
other
corporate
bonds
, , O
'' '' O
says
Craig
J
Goldberg
, , O
managing
director
and
head
of
the
asset
securities
group
at
Merrill
Lynch
Capital
Markets
. . O

But
skeptics
question
whether
asset
bonds
offer
sufficient
rewards
to
compensate
for
the
extra
risks
. . O

Consider
a
$ $ I
500
million
offering
of
9
% NN
securities
issued
last
spring
and
backed
by
Citibank
credit
receivables
. . O

The
triple
issue
offered
a
yield
of
only
about
0
percentage
point
above
four
Treasury
issues
. . O

On
a
$ $ I
10
investment
, , O
that
's
a
difference
of
only
$ $ I
50
a
year
. . O

That
kind
of
spread
can
be
critical
for
money
managers
who
buy
bonds
in
large
quantities
and
whose
livelihood
depends
on
outperforming
the
money
manager
across
the
street
. . O

But
for
individuals
who
buy
much
smaller
amounts
and
care
less
about
relative
performance
than
in
preserving
what
they
have
, , O
that
margin
is
meaningless
. . O

`` `` O
If
you
're
in
the
bond
business
playing
the
relative
derby
, , O
then
even
an
extra
25
basis
points
-LRB
0
percentage
point
-RRB
becomes
an
important
consideration
on
a
career
basis
, , O
'' '' O
says
Mr
Grant
. . O

`` `` O
But
if
you
're
an
individual
investing
money
and
trying
to
get
it
back
again
, , O
then
that
is
n
of
overwhelming
importance
. . O
'' '' O

Moreover
, , O
the
interest
on
asset
securities
is
fully
taxable
, , O
while
interest
on
Treasury
issues
is
tax
at
the
state
and
local
level
. . O

That
's
why
some
investment
managers
, , O
such
as
Alex
Powers
, , O
a
vice
president
of
Chase
Manhattan
Bank
's
private
banking
division
, , O
do
n
recommend
most
asset
issues
for
individuals
in
high
states
, , O
such
as
New
York
or
California
. . O

But
Mr
Powers
has
purchased
asset
issues
for
individuals
with
tax
accounts
, , O
such
as
retirement
plans
. . O

He
points
out
that
institutions
buying
asset
issues
in
large
quantities
can
earn
higher
spreads
over
Treasurys
than
individuals
buying
smaller
amounts
. . O

Another
concern
is
liquidity
, , O
or
how
easily
a
security
can
be
converted
into
cash
. . O

The
secondary
, , I
or
resale
, , I
market
for
asset
securities
is
relatively
new
and
much
less
active
than
for
Treasury
issues
. . O

That
could
make
it
tricky
for
investors
who
need
to
sell
their
holdings
quickly
before
the
securities
mature
. . O

That
's
particularly
true
, , O
analysts
say
, , O
for
certain
of
the
securities
, , O
such
as
those
backed
by
time
loans
. . O

`` `` O
You
could
see
massive
gyrations
here
because
it
's
such
a
thinly
traded
market
, , O
'' '' O
says
Jonathan
S
Paris
, , O
a
vice
president
of
European
Investors
Inc
, , O
a
New
York
investment
firm
. . O

In
addition
, , O
an
investor
who
wants
to
know
the
daily
value
of
Treasury
bonds
, , O
or
corporate
bonds
traded
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
, , O
can
simply
check
newspaper
listings
. . O

There
are
n
any
such
listings
for
asset
securities
. . O

Evaluating
asset
securities
poses
another
problem
. . O

Investors
, , O
for
instance
, , O
may
mistakenly
assume
that
the
bank
or
company
that
originally
held
the
assets
is
guaranteeing
the
securities
. . O

It
is
n
. . O

The
front
cover
of
the
prospectus
for
the
Citibank
credit
receivables
offering
points
out
in
bold
capital
letters
that
the
certificates
represent
an
interest
only
in
the
specially
created
trust
and
`` `` O
do
not
represent
interests
in
or
obligations
of
the
banks
, , O
Citibank
N
, , O
Citicorp
or
any
affiliate
thereof
. . O
'' '' O

In
other
words
, , O
if
there
's
a
problem
, , O
do
n
expect
Citibank
to
come
to
the
rescue
. . O

The
prospectus
also
notes
that
the
securities
are
not
guaranteed
by
any
government
agency
. . O

That
means
investors
have
to
focus
on
the
quality
of
the
debt
that
lies
beneath
the
securities
, , O
as
well
as
on
the
credit
enhancement
for
the
issue
and
the
credit
ratings
the
issue
has
received
. . O

That
also
is
n
easy
. . O

Take
the
`` `` I
credit
enhancements
, , O
'' '' O
which
typically
include
a
bank
letter
of
credit
or
insurance
from
a
bond
company
. . O

The
letter
of
credit
typically
is
not
offered
by
the
bank
selling
the
assets
to
back
the
securities
. . O

Nor
does
it
cover
the
entire
portfolio
. . O

Details
of
credit
enhancements
vary
widely
from
issue
to
issue
. . O

Still
, , O
they
play
a
crucial
role
in
winning
top
ratings
for
most
asset
issues
-- : O
which
in
turn
is
why
the
yield
above
Treasurys
is
so
slim
. . O

But
skeptics
ask
why
you
should
bother
buying
this
stuff
when
you
can
get
only
slightly
lower
yields
on
government
paper
. . O

When
you
buy
an
asset
issue
, , O
you
take
the
risk
that
a
bank
or
an
insurer
could
run
into
unexpected
difficulties
. . O

If
a
bank
's
credit
rating
was
lowered
because
of
, , O
say
, , O
its
loans
to
Third
World
nations
, , O
that
could
also
affect
the
ratings
, , I
liquidity
and
prices
of
the
asset
issues
that
the
bank
supports
. . O

Underwriters
insist
these
issues
are
constructed
to
withstand
extremely
tough
economic
conditions
. . O

But
despite
the
credit
enhancements
, , O
despite
the
high
ratings
, , O
some
money
managers
still
worry
that
a
recession
could
wreak
havoc
on
the
underlying
assets
. . O

At
a
time
when
Americans
are
leveraged
to
their
eyeballs
, , O
asset
investors
may
be
taking
a
heady
gamble
that
consumers
will
be
able
to
repay
loans
in
hard
times
. . O

At
the
very
least
, , O
a
recession
would
prompt
investors
to
buy
the
highest
bonds
they
can
find
-- : O
that
is
, , O
Treasurys
. . O

That
could
widen
the
yield
spread
between
Treasurys
and
asset
securities
, , O
as
well
as
make
it
tougher
to
unload
the
latter
. . O

But
it
could
be
much
worse
. . O

Some
analysts
are
especially
wary
of
credit
issues
. . O

For
one
thing
, , O
credit
loans
are
unsecured
. . O

In
addition
, , O
they
fear
that
banks
have
been
overeager
to
issue
cards
to
the
public
-- : O
giving
cards
to
too
many
big
spenders
who
will
default
during
a
recession

`` `` O

reckoning

coming
where
we
think
the

will
place

and
therefore

IF
YOU
FORCE
financial
planners
to
sum
up
their
most
important
advice
in
a
single
sentence
, , O
it
would
probably
be
a
one
sentence
: : O
Diversify
. . O

Judging
by
a
poll
of
Wall
Street
Journal
readers
conducted
this
summer
by
Erdos
& CC
Morgan
Inc
, , O
serious
investors
have
taken
that
advice
to
heart
. . O

Nearly
1
investors
responded
to
the
Journal
's
poll
, , O
providing
an
in
look
at
their
portfolios
. . O

Those
portfolios
are
remarkably
diversified
. . O

By
spreading
their
wealth
among
several
investment
alternatives
, , O
the
respondents
have
protected
themselves
against
squalls
in
any
one
area
, , O
be
it
stocks
, , O
bonds
or
real
estate
. . O

For
example
, , O
about
88
% NN
of
Journal
readers
owned
stock
-LRB
down
slightly
from
91
% NN
in
a
similar
poll
last
year
-RRB
. . O

But
only
17
% NN
said
they
had
more
than
half
their
money
in
the
stock
market
. . O

Similarly
, , O
57
% NN
of
respondents
own
shares
in
a
money
mutual
fund
, , O
and
33
% NN
own
municipal
bonds
. . O

But
only
6
% NN
to
7
% NN
of
the
investors
were
committing
more
than
half
their
funds
to
either
of
those
alternatives
. . O

The
poll
, , O
conducted
Aug
7
, , O
also
provides
a
glimpse
into
the
thinking
of
serious
investors
on
a
variety
of
other
topics
. . O

It
found
them
in
a
cautious
, , I
but
not
downbeat
, , I
mood
. . O

Of
1
people
sent
a
questionnaire
, , O
951
replied
. . O

The
response
rate
, , O
more
than
63
% NN
, , O
allows
the
results
to
be
interpreted
with
a
high
degree
of
confidence
. . O

The
results
ca
n
be
extrapolated
to
all
investors
, , O
though
. . O

Journal
readers
are
relatively
affluent
, , O
with
a
median
household
income
of
between
$ $ I
75
and
$ $ I
99
. . O

Nearly
half
of
the
respondents
-LRB
47
% NN
-RRB
said
their
investment
portfolio
was
worth
$ $ B
250
or
more
, , O
and
17
% NN
said
it
was
worth
$ $ B
1
million
or
more
. . O

The
respondents
were
mildly
optimistic
about
the
economy
and
investment
markets
, , O
but
their
collective
judgments
were
a
notch
more
sober
than
they
were
a
year
ago
. . O

For
example
, , O
12
% NN
of
this
year
's
respondents
said
they
expect
a
recession
within
12
months
. . O

Last
year
, , O
only
8
% NN
were
expecting
a
recession
. . O

An
additional
56
% NN
of
this
year
's
respondents
expect
the
economy
to
slow
down
during
the
next
12
months
. . O

Only
42
% NN
of
last
year
's
respondents
anticipated
slowing
growth
. . O

Apparently
, , O
the
respondents
do
n
think
that
an
economic
slowdown
would
harm
the
major
investment
markets
very
much
. . O

A
slim
majority
-LRB
51
% NN
-RRB
think
stock
prices
will
be
higher
in
August
1990
than
they
were
in
August
1989
. . O

Their
verdict
on
real
estate
is
almost
the
same
. . O

Some
50
% NN
expect
real
estate
in
their
local
area
to
increase
in
value
over
the
next
12
months
. . O

By
contrast
, , O
only
32
% NN
expect
an
increase
in
the
price
of
gold
. . O

Since
gold
tends
to
soar
when
inflation
is
high
, , O
that
finding
suggests
that
people
believe
inflation
remains
under
control
. . O

Even
though
only
12
% NN
actually
predicted
a
recession
, , O
many
respondents
were
taking
a
better
sorry
investment
stance
. . O

Nearly
a
third
said
they
have
made
some
portfolio
changes
to
anticipate
a
possible
recession
. . O

For
the
most
part
, , O
the
changes
were
`` `` O
slight
. . O
'' '' O

The
two
who
have
n
tried
to
make
their
portfolios
more
recession
were
split
about
evenly
between
investors
who
`` `` O
do
n
believe
in
trying
to
predict
the
markets
'' '' O
-LRB
about
31
% NN
-RRB
and
investors
who
`` `` B
do
n
expect
a
recession
'' '' O
-LRB
about
15
% NN
-RRB
or
are
`` `` O
unsure
if
and
when
a
recession
might
come
'' '' O
-LRB
about
22
% NN
-RRB
. . O

A
buy
approach
to
stocks
continues
to
be
the
rule
among
respondents
. . O

Most
own
two
to
10
stocks
, , O
and
buy
or
sell
no
more
than
three
times
a
year
. . O

Some
71
% NN
had
bought
some
stock
in
the
past
year
; : O
only
57
% NN
had
sold
any
. . O

But
the
lurking
shadow
of
1987
's
stock
crash
still
seems
dark
. . O

About
33
% NN
considered
another
crash
`` `` O
likely
, , O
'' '' O
while
about
63
% NN
said
one
is
`` `` O
unlikely
. . O
'' '' O

Those
percentages
hardly
changed
from
the
previous
year
's
poll
. . O

And
the
respondents
' POS
commitment
to
the
stock
market
remains
somewhat
lighter
than
usual
. . O

About
60
% NN
of
them
said
they
would
`` `` O
ordinarily
'' '' O
have
at
least
25
% NN
of
their
money
in
stocks
. . O

But
as
of
August
, , O
only
50
% NN
actually
had
stock
investments
of
that
size
. . O

Most
stock
indexes
were
hitting
all
highs
at
around
the
time
of
the
poll
. . O

But
it
appears
that
many
Journal
readers
were
taking
that
news
as
a
sign
to
be
cautious
, , O
rather
than
a
signal
to
jump
on
the
bandwagon

The

$ $ B
21
million

over
10

and
Institut
Merieux

rival
bid
of

942

The
University
is
seeking
an
injunction
against

arguing
that
Connaught

predecessor
company
agreed
in
1972
that
Connaught

ownership
would

be
transferred
to
foreigners

perch
, , O
only
a
few
steps
from
the
very
top
of

stands
. . O

From
my
orange
seat
, , O
I
looked
over
the
first
line
and
the
new
ball
field
in
the
warm
sun
of
the
last
few
minutes
before
what
was
to
have
been
the
third
game
of
the
World
Series
. . O

It
was
five
in
the
afternoon
, , O
but
that
was
Pacific
time
. . O

Back
in
New
York
the
work
day
was
already
over
, , O
so
I
did
n
have
to
feel
guilty
. . O

Even
still
, , O
I
did
feel
self
, , O
and
I
could
n
help
remembering
my
father
's
contempt
for
a
rich
medical
colleague
who
would
go
to
watch
the
Tigers
on
summer
afternoons
. . O

This
ballpark
, , O
the
Stick
, , O
was
not
a
classic
baseball
stadium
-- : O
too
symmetrical
, , O
too
much
bald
concrete
. . O

And
it
did
n
have
the
crowded
wild
intimacy
of
Yankee
Stadium
. . O

But
I
liked
the
easy
friendliness
of
the
people
around
me
, , O
liked
it
that
they
'd
brought
their
children
, , O
found
it
charming
that
, , O
true
citizens
of
the
state
of
the
future
, , O
they
had
brought
so
many
TVs
and
radios
to
stay
in
touch
with
electroreality
at
a
live
event
. . O

Maybe
it
was
their
peculiar
sense
of
history
. . O

The
broadcasters
were
, , O
after
all
, , O
documenting
the
game
, , O
ratifying
its
occurrence
for
millions
outside
the
Stick
. . O

Why
not
watch
or
hear
your
experience
historicized
while
you
were
living
it
? . O

The
day
was
saturated
with
the
weight
of
its
own
impending
history
. . O

Long
lines
of
people
waited
to
buy
special
souvenir
World
Series
postcards
with
official
postmarks
. . O

Thousands
of
us
had
paid
$ $ B
5
for
the
official
souvenir
book
with
its
historical
essays
on
Series
trivia
, , O
its
historical
photographs
of
great
moments
in
Series
past
, , O
and
its
instructions
, , O
in
English
and
Spanish
, , O
for
filling
in
the
scorecard
. . O

Pitcher

. . O

Homerun

jonron
. . O

Players
ran
out
on
the
field
way
below
, , O
and
the
stands
began
to
reverberate
. . O

It
must
be
a
local
custom
, , O
I
thought
, , O
stamping
feet
to
welcome
the
team
. . O

But
then
the
noise
turned
into
a
roar
. . O

And
no
one
was
shouting
. . O

No
one
around
me
was
saying
anything
. . O

Because
we
all
were
busy
riding
a
wave
. . O

Sixty
thousand
surfers
atop
a
concrete
wall
, , O
waiting
for
the
wipeout
. . O

Only
at
the
moment
of
maximum
roll
did
I
grasp
what
was
going
on
. . O

Then
I
remembered
the
quake
of
'71
, , O
which
I
experienced
in
Santa
Barbara
in
a
second
motel
room
. . O

When
the
swaying
of
the
building
woke
me
up
, , O
I
reasoned
that
a
-RRB
I
was
in
Southern
California
; : O
b
-RRB
the
bed
was
moving
; : O
c
-RRB
it
must
be
a
Magic
Fingers
bed
that
had
short
. . O

Then
I
noticed
the
overhead
light
was
swaying
on
its
cord
and
realized
what
had
happened
. . O

What
should
I
do
? . O

Get
out
of
the
possibly
collapsing
building
to
the
parking
lot
. . O

But
the
lot
might
split
into
crevasses
, , O
so
I
had
better
stand
on
my
car
, , O
which
probably
was
wider
than
the
average
crevasse
. . O

Fortunately
, , O
the
quake
was
over
before
I
managed
to
run
out
and
stand
naked
on
the
hood
. . O

At
the
Stick
, , O
while
the
world
shook
, , O
I
thought
of
that
morning
and
then
it
struck
me
that
this
time
was
different
. . O

If
I
survived
, , O
I
would
have
achieved
every
journalist
's
highest
wish
. . O

I
was
an
eyewitness
of
the
most
newsworthy
event
on
the
planet
at
that
moment
. . O

What
was
my
angle
? . O

How
would
I
file
? . O

All
these
thoughts
raced
through
my
head
in
the
15
seconds
of
the
earthquake
's
actual
duration
. . O

The
rest
is
, , O
of
course
, , O
history
. . O

The
Stick
did
n
fall
. . O

The
real
tragedies
occurred
elsewhere
, , O
as
we
soon
found
out
. . O

But
for
a
few
minutes
there
, , O
relief
abounded
. . O

A
young
mother
found
her
boy
, , O
who
had
been
out
buying
a
hotdog
. . O

The
wall
behind
me
was
slightly
deformed
, , O
but
the
center
had
held
. . O

And
most
of
us
waited
for
a
while
for
the
game
to
start
. . O

Then
we
began
to
file
out
, , O
to
wait
safely
on
terra
firma
for
the
opening
pitch
. . O

It
was
during
the
quiet
exodus
down
the
pristine
concrete
ramps
of
the
Stick
that
I
really
understood
the
point
of
all
those
Walkmen
and
Watchmen
. . O

The
crowd
moved
in
clumps
, , O
clumps
magnetized
around
an
electronic
nucleus
. . O

In
this
way
, , O
while
the
Stick
itself
was
blacked
out
, , O
we
kept
up
to
date
on
events
. . O

Within
15
minutes
of
the
quake
itself
, , O
I
was
able
to
see
pictures
of
the
collapsed
section
of
the
Bay
Bridge
. . O

Increasingly
accurate
estimates
of
the
severity
of
the
quake
became
available
before
I
got
to
my
car
. . O

And
by
then
, , O
expensive
automobile
sound
systems
were
keeping
the
gridlocked
parking
lot
by
the
bay
informed
about
the
fire
causing
the
big
black
plume
of
smoke
we
saw
on
the
northern
horizon
. . O

Darkness
fell
. . O

But
the
broadcasts
continued
through
the
blacked
night
, , O
with
pictures
of
the
sandwiched
highway
ganglion
in
Oakland
and
firefighting
in
the
Marina
district
. . O

By
then
, , O
our
little
sand
village
of
cars
had
been
linked
with
a
global
village
of
listeners
and
viewers
. . O

Everyone
at
the
Stick
that
day
had
started
out
as
a
spectator
and
ended
up
as
a
participant
. . O

In
fact
, , O
the
entire
population
of
the
Bay
Area
had
ended
up
with
this
dual
role
of
actor
and
audience
. . O

The
reporters
were
victims
and
some
of
the
victims
turned
into
unofficial
reporters
. . O

The
outstanding
example
of
this
was
the
motorist
on
the
Bay
Bridge
who
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
take
out
a
video
camera
at
the
absolutely
crucial
moment
and
record
the
car
in
front
as
it
fell
into
the
gap
in
the
roadway
. . O

The
tape
was
on
tv
before
the
night
was
out
. . O

Marshall
McLuhan
, , O
you
should
have
been
there
at
that
hour
. . O

Investors
who
received
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc
's
latest
stock
commentary
may
be
left
with
blank
expressions
. . O

The
first
10
pages
of
the
76
Weekly
Portfolio
Perspective
are
completely
blank
, , O
except
for
the
page
numbers
. . O

Rather
than
printing
devils
, , O
Shearson
puts
all
the
blame
on
the
unpredictable
stock
market
. . O

The
plunge
made
Shearson
's
market
commentary
instantly
out
of
date
. . O

In
fact
, , O
last
Friday
's
190
tumble
in
the
stock
market
caught
many
people
and
businesses
by
surprise
, , O
not
the
least
of
them
brokerage
firms
such
as
Shearson
that
print
their
weekly
market
commentaries
on
Fridays
for
dissemination
the
following
week
. . O

Shearson
, , O
a
62
unit
of
American
Express
Co
, , O
did
n
have
enough
time
to
update
its
market
commentary
so
, , O
`` `` O
We
decided
to
kill
our
strategy
pieces
, , O
'' '' O
says
Jack
Rivkin
, , O
the
head
of
Shearson
's
research
department
. . O

The
first
thought
some
investors
had
was
that
a
red
Shearson
must
have
been
wildly
bullish
on
stocks
in
its
original
commentary
, , O
and
that
's
why
it
purged
its
pages
. . O

Investors
recalled
that
Shearson
last
week
had
been
advising
that
`` `` O
the
market
is
still
exhibiting
all
the
signs
of
a
further
advance
. . O
'' '' O

Many
other
brokerage
firms
had
similarly
bullish
views
. . O

But
Mr
Rivkin
insists
that
the
10
pages
were
n
pulled
because
they
were
too
bullish
. . O

Instead
, , O
he
says
, , O
`` `` O
they
were
cautious
, , O
and
that
was
n
the
message
we
wanted
to
deliver
'' '' O
on
Monday
. . O

As
Mr
Rivkin
explains
it
, , O
`` `` O
We
were
raising
some
caution
flags
about
rate
rises
in
Europe
and
concerns
about
the
LBO
market
. . O

And
by
late
Friday
afternoon
, , O
actually
after
the
close
, , O
we
decided
that
was
the
wrong
tone
to
take
. . O

With
the
market
down
, , O
we
wanted
to
tell
people
to
put
their
orders
in
on
the
opening
. . O
'' '' O

Both
before
and
after
the
Friday
plunge
, , O
Shearson
has
maintained
a
recommended
portfolio
weighting
of
65
% NN
stocks
, , O
20
% NN
bonds
and
15
% NN

China
's
slide
toward
recession
is
beginning
to
look
like
a
free
fall

In
a
report
on
China
's
foundering
economy
, , O
the
official
State
Statistical
Bureau
disclosed
that
industrial
output
last
month
rose
0
% NN
from
a
year
earlier
- : O
the
lowest
growth
rate
in
a
decade
for
September
. . O

Retail
sales
are
plummeting
, , O
while
consumer
prices
still
are
rising

Chinese
and
foreign
economists
now
predict
prolonged
stagflation
: : O
low
growth
and
high
inflation

`` `` O
The
economy
is
crashing
hard

'' '' O
says
an

economist
in

`` `` O
The
slowdown
is
taking
hold
a

more
quickly

devastatingly
than
anyone
had
expected

'' '' O

A
lengthy
recession
, , O
if
it
materializes
, , O
would
drain
state
coffers
and
create
severe
hardships
for
urban
workers
. . O

Experts
predict
the
coming
year
will
be
characterized
by
flat
or
negative
industrial
growth
, , O
rising
unemployment
and
a
widening
budget
deficit

Unless
the

suddenly
reverses

wages
for

workers
wo
n
keep
pace
with
inflation
, , O
creating
a
potential
source

urban
unrest

The
economy
's
slowdown
is
due
only
partly
to
the
austerity
program
launched
in
September
1988
to
cool
an
overheated
economy
and
tame
inflation

Industrial
output
surged
21
% NN
in
1988
, , O
while
inflation
peaked
last
February
at
nearly
30
% NN
. . O
-RRB

The
slowdown
also
results
from
chronic
energy
and
raw
shortages
that
force
many
factories
to
restrict
operations
to
two
or
three
days
a
week
. . O

In
Western
, , I
market
countries
, , O
recessions
often
have
a
bright
side
: : O
prodding
the
economy
to
greater
efficiency
. . O

In
China
, , O
however
, , O
there
is
n
likely
to
be
any
silver
lining
because
the
economy
remains
guided
primarily
by
the
state
. . O

Instead
, , O
China
is
likely
to
shell
out
ever
subsidies
to
its
coddled
state
enterprises
, , O
which
ate
up
$ $ B
18
billion
in
bailouts
last
year
. . O

Nor
are
any
of
these
inefficient
monoliths
likely
to
be
allowed
to
go
bankrupt
. . O

Rather
, , O
the
brunt
of
the
slowdown
will
be
felt
in
the
fast
private
and
semi
`` `` I
township
'' '' I
enterprises
, , O
which
have
fallen
into
disfavor
as
China
's
leaders
re
an
orthodox
Marxist
preference
for
public
ownership
. . O

`` `` O
When
the
going
gets
rough
, , O
China
penalizes
the
efficient
and
rewards
the
incompetent

'' '' O
says
a
Western
economist

Reports
of
an
economy
near
recession
come
as
officials
prepare
a
major
Communist
Party
plenum
for
sometime
in
the
next
few
weeks
. . O

The
meeting
is
expected
to
call
for
heightened
austerity
for
two
years
. . O

But
with
industrial
growth
stagnant
and
inflation
showing
signs
of
easing
, , O
some
voices
may
call
for
measures
to
pump
new
life
into
the
economy
. . O

Some
analysts
believe
China
soon
will
begin
relaxing
economic
controls
, , O
particularly
by
loosening
credit
. . O

That
would
benefit
Chinese
enterprises
as
well
as
Sino
joint
ventures
, , O
both
of
which
have
been
plagued
by
shortages
of
working
capital
. . O

A
dangerous
buildup
this
year
of
billions
of
dollars
in
inter
debts
threatens
, , O
if
unchecked
, , O
to
bring
the
economy
to
a
collapse
. . O

One
sign
of
a
possible
easing
of
credit
policy
was
the
decision
this
week
of
People
's
Bank
of
China
, , O
the
central
bank
, , O
to
allocate
$ $ B
5
billion
in
short
loans
to
pay
farmers
for
the
autumn
harvest
, , O
the
official
China
Daily
reported
. . O

But
while
pumping
more
money
into
the
economy
would
bring
relief
to
many
industries
, , O
it
also
runs
the
risk
of
triggering
another
period
of
runaway
growth
and
steep
inflation
. . O

The
cycle
has
been
repeated
several
times
since
China
began
reforming
its
planned
economy
in
1979
. . O

And
, , O
because
China
's
leaders
have
abandoned
plans
to
drastically
reform
the
economy
, , O
it
is
likely
to
continue
, , O
analysts
say

`` `` O

tax
treatment

an
effort
that
is
likely
to
succeed
in
this
Congress

Other
fundamental
`` `` I
reforms

of
the
1986

been
threatened

The
House
seriously
considered
raising
the
top
tax
rate

individuals

the
highest
incomes

The
Senate
Finance

voted
to
expand
the
deduction
for

retirement
accounts

and
also
to
bring
back
income
averaging
for

a
tax
preference
that
allows
income
to
be
spread
out
over
several
years

As
part
of
the
same
bill

the

To

the

last

stripped
away
all

But
lawmakers

`` `` O

In

capital
provision

But
Sotheby

, , O
Christie

and
the
National
Association
of
Antique

are
still
trying
to
get
theirs

They
have
sent
a
letter
to
congressional
tax
asking
that
gains
from
the
sale
of

also
be
given
preferential
treatment

`` `` O
Collectibles

continue
to
be
recognized

the
letter
states

All
of
this
talk
is
antithetical
to
the
Tax
Reform
Act
of

In
exchange
for
dramatically
lower
tax
rates
, , O
the
framers
of

legislation
sought
to
eliminate
most
of
the
exemptions
, , I
deductions
and
credits
that
gave
some
taxpayers
an
advantage
over
others
. . O

The
goal
was
to
tax
people
with
roughly
equivalent
incomes
equally
, , O
and
to
eliminate
the
many
shelters
that
allowed
the
wealthy
to
escape
taxes
. . O

Two
of
the
major
ways
that
tax
managed
to
attain
these
ends
were
to
scrap
the
preferential
treatment
of
capital
gains
and
to
curtail
the
use
of
paper
losses
, , O
also
known
as
passive
losses
, , O
that
made
many
tax
shelters
possible

Many
other
tax
benefits
also
were
swept
away

This
year
Congress
, , O
with
prodding
from
President
Bush
, , O
has
been
busy
trying
to
put
many
of
these
same
tax
preferences
back
into
the
code
. . O

It
appears
likely
that
, , O
this
year
or
next
, , O
some
form
of
capital
preference
and
passive
restoration
will
be
enacted

Other
tax
benefits
probably
will
be
restored
and
created

The
main
obstacle
is
finding
a
way
to
pay
for
them

`` `` O

private
eye

and
she

him
to
live
off
the
million
dollars
she

settled
on
him

That
's
Chandler
's
setup

Mr
Parker
spins
it
into
a
pretty
satisfying
tale
involving
Poodle
Springs
high
life
, , O
Hollywood
low
life
and
various
folk
who
hang
their
hats
in
both
worlds
. . O

The
supporting
lineup
is
solid

the
patter

amusing

there
's
even
a
cameo
by
Bernie
Ohls
, , O
the
`` `` I
good
cop
'' '' O
of
previous
Chandler
books
who
still
does
n
hesitate
to
have
Marlowe
jailed
when
it
suits

purposes

The
style
throughout

a
strong
resemblance

Chandler
's
prose
at

most
pared
down

All
told

Mr
Parker
does
a
better
job
of
making
a
novel
out
of
this
abandoned
fragment
than
anyone
might
have
had
a
right
to
expect
. . O

But
there
are
grounds
for
complaint
. . O

At
one
point
, , O
the
reader
is
two
steps
ahead
of
Marlowe
in
catching
on
to
a
double
identity
scam
-- : O
and
Marlowe
is
supposed
to
be
the
pro
. . O

More
bothersome
, , O
there
are
several
apparent
anachronisms
. . O

Contact
lenses
, , O
tank
tops
, , O
prostitutes
openly
working
the
streets
of
Hollywood
and
the
Tequila
Sunrise
cocktail
all
seem
out
of
place
in
the
1950s
. . O

A
little
more
care
in
re
Marlowe
's
universe
would
have
made
the
book
that
much
more
enjoyable

The
lonely
woman

on
in

direction

the
Plaza

Alonso
Martinez

Two
men
have
a
conversation
behind
one
of
the
windows
of
the
cafe
on
the
corner
of
the
boulevard

Both
are
young

one
twenty

jury

the
younger

evident
that

conversation
runs
more
or

on
the
following
lines
: : O
`` `` O

`` `` O

on
revenue

Both
revenue
figures
exclude
excise
taxes

The
charges
consist
of

a
$ $ I
25
million
after
charge
to
cover
cost
overruns

Ashland

Riley

15

Ashland
expects
that
sale
to
be
complete
next

The
charge
for
the
Riley
subsidiary
is
for
expected
costs
to
correct
problems

The

When
President

arrives
here
next
week
for
a
hemispheric
summit
organized

commemorate
a
century

Costa
Rican
democracy

will
he
be
able
to
deliver
a
credible
message
in
the
wake
of
the
Panamanian
fiasco

Undoubtedly
Mr
Bush
will
be
praised
by
some
Latin
leaders
prone
to
pay
lip
service
to
nonintervention
, , O
while
they
privately
encourage
more
assertive
U
action
to
remove
Gen
Manuel
Noriega
and
safeguard
their
countries
from
a
Sandinista
onslaught
. . O

The
Panamanian
affair
is
only
the
tip
of
a
more
alarming
iceberg
. . O

It
originates
in
a
Bush
administration
decision
not
to
antagonize
the
U
Congress
and
avoid
, , O
at
all
costs
, , O
being
accused
of
meddling
in
the
region
. . O

The
result
has
been
a
dangerous
vacuum
of
U
leadership
, , O
which
leaves
Central
America
open
to
Soviet
adventurism
. . O

`` `` O
The
-LCB
influence
of
the
-RCB
U
is
not
being
felt
in
Central
America
; : O
Washington
's
decisions
do
not
respond
to
a
policy
, , O
and
are
divorced
from
reality
, , O
'' '' O
says
Fernando
Volio
, , O
a
Costa
Rican
congressman
and
former
foreign
minister
. . O

The
disarray
of
the
Bush
administration
's
Latin
diplomacy
was
evident
in
the
failure
of
the
Organization
of
American
States
to
condemn
categorically
Gen
Noriega
. . O

Faced
with
this
embarrassment
, , O
U
diplomats
expressed
confidence
that
the
influential
Rio
Group
of
South
American
nations
, , O
which
gathered
last
week
in
Peru
, , O
would
take
a
stronger
posture
toward
the
Panamanian
dictator
. . O

But
other
than
a
few
slaps
on
the
wrist
, , O
Gen
Noriega
went
unpunished
by
that
body
, , O
too
; : O
he
was
not
even
singled
out
in
the
closing
statement
. . O

Now
Mr
Bush
will
come
to
Costa
Rica
and
encounter
Nicaraguan
strongman
Daniel
Ortega
, , O
eager
for
photo
opportunities
with
the
U
president
. . O

The
host
, , O
Costa
Rican
President
Oscar
Arias
, , O
did
not
invite
Chile
, , I
Cuba
, , I
Panama
or
Haiti
to
the
summit
, , O
which
was
to
be
restricted
to
democracies
. . O

However
, , O
Mr
Ortega
was
included
. . O

Formally
upgrading
the
Sandinistas
to
a
democratic
status
was
an
initiative
harshly
criticized
in
the
Costa
Rican
press
. . O

Even
Carlos
Manuel
Castillo
-- : O
the
presidential
candidate
for
Mr
Arias
's
National
Liberation
Party
-- : O
made
public
his
opposition
to
the
presence
of
Nicaragua
`` `` O
in
a
democratic
festivity
. . O
'' '' O

Nevertheless
, , O
the
Bush
administration
agreed
to
the
dubious
arrangement
in
July
, , O
a
few
weeks
before
the
Central
American
presidents
met
in
Tela
, , O
Honduras
, , O
to
discuss
a
timetable
for
disbanding
the
anti
rebels
. . O

According
to
officials
in
Washington
, , O
the
State
Department
hoped
that
by
pleasing
President
Arias
, , O
it
would
gain
his
support
to
postpone
any
decision
on
the
Contras
until
after
Mr
Ortega
's
promises
of
democratic
elections
were
tested
next
February
. . O

However
, , O
relying
on
an
ardent
critic
of
the
Reagan
administration
and
the
Contra
movement
for
help
in
delaying
the
disarming
of
the
Contras
was
risky
business
. . O

And
even
some
last
phone
calls
that
Mr
Bush
made
-LRB
at
the
behest
of
some
conservative
U
senators
-RRB
to
enlist
backing
for
the
U
position
failed
to
stop
the
march
of
Mr
Arias
's
agenda
. . O

Prior
to
this
episode
, , O
Sen
Christopher
Dodd
-LRB
D
, , O
Conn
-RRB
, , O
sensing
an
open
field
, , O
undertook
a
personal
diplomatic
mission
through
Central
America
to
promote
an
early
disbanding
of
the
rebels
. . O

Visiting
Nicaragua
, , O
he
praised
the
Sandinistas
for
their
electoral
system
and
chided
the
Bush
administration
for
not
rewarding
the
Sandinistas
. . O

In
Honduras
, , O
where
the
Contras
are
a
hot
political
issue
, , O
he
promised
to
help
unblock
some
$ $ I
70
million
in
assistance
withheld
due
to
the
failure
of
local
agencies
to
comply
with
conditions
agreed
upon
with
Washington
. . O

Aid
was
also
the
gist
of
the
talks
Sen
Dodd
had
with
Salvadoran
President
Alfredo
Cristiani
; : O
Mr
Cristiani
's
government
is
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
U
largess
and
is
forced
to
listen
very
carefully
to
Sen
Dodd
's
likes
and
dislikes
. . O

It
was
therefore
not
surprising
that
close
allies
of
the
U
, , O
virtually
neglected
by
the
Bush
administration
, , O
ordered
the
Nicaraguan
insurgents
dismantled
by
December
, , O
long
before
the
elections
. . O

Fittingly
, , O
the
Tela
Accords
were
nicknamed
by
Hondurans
`` `` O
the
Dodd
plan
. . O
'' '' O

The
individual
foreign
policy
carried
out
by
U
legislators
adds
to
a
confusing
U
performance
that
has
emboldened
Soviet
initiatives
in
Central
America
. . O

On
Oct
3
, , O
following
conversations
with
Secretary
of
State
James
Baker
, , O
Soviet
Foreign
Minister
Eduard
Shevardnadze
arrived
in
Managua
to
acclaim
`` `` O
Nicaragua
's
great
peace
efforts
. . O
'' '' O

There
, , O
Mr
Shevardnadze
felt
legitimized
to
unveil
his
own
peace
plan
: : O
The
U
would
prolong
a
suspension
of
arms
shipments
to
Nicaragua
after
the
February
election
if
the
U
did
likewise
with
its
allies
in
Central
America
. . O

He
also
called
on
Nicaragua
's
neighbors
to
accept
a
`` `` I
military
equilibrium
'' '' O
guaranteed
by
both
superpowers
. . O

The
Pentagon
claims
that
in
spite
of
Moscow
's
words
, , O
East
bloc
weapons
continue
to
flow
into
Nicaragua
through
Cuba
at
near
levels
. . O

Since
Mr
Shevardnadze
's
proposals
followed
discussions
with
Mr
Baker
, , O
speculations
arose
that
the
Bush
administration
was
seeking
an
accommodation
with
the
Soviets
in
Central
America
. . O

This
scheme
would
fit
the
Arias
Plan
, , O
which
declared
a
false
symmetry
between
Soviet
military
aid
to
the
Sandinista
dictatorship
and
that
provided
by
Washington
to
freely
elected
governments
. . O

Furthermore
, , O
it
is
also
likely
to
encourage
those
on
Capitol
Hill
asking
for
cuts
in
the
assistance
to
El
Salvador
if
President
Cristiani
does
not
bend
to
demands
of
the
Marxist
guerrillas
. . O

The
sad
condition
of
U
policy
in
Central
America
is
best
depicted
by
the
recent
end
to
U
sponsorship
of
Radio
Costa
Rica
. . O

In
1984
, , O
the
Costa
Rican
government
requested
help
to
establish
a
radio
station
in
the
northern
part
of
the
country
, , O
flooded
by
airwaves
of
Sandinista
propaganda
. . O

Recovering
radiophonic
sovereignty
was
the
purpose
of
Radio
Costa
Rica
, , O
funded
by
the
U
and
affiliated
with
the
Voice
of
America
-LRB
VOA
-RRB
. . O

A
few
months
ago
, , O
the
Bush
administration
decided
to
stop
this
cooperation
, , O
leaving
Radio
Costa
Rica
operating
on
a
shoestring
. . O

According
to
news
reports
, , O
the
abrupt
termination
was
due
to
fears
that
VOA
transmissions
could
interfere
with
the
peace
process
. . O

In
the
meantime
, , O
Russia
gave
Nicaragua
another
powerful
radio
transmitter
, , O
which
has
been
installed
in
the
city
of
Esteli
. . O

It
is
capable
of
reaching
the
entire
Caribbean
area
and
deep
into
North
America
. . O

Perhaps
its
loud
signal
may
generate
some
awareness
of
the
Soviet
condominium
being
created
in
the
isthmus
thanks
to
U
default
. . O

The
Soviet
entrenchment
in
Nicaragua
is
alarming
for
Costa
Rica
, , O
a
peaceful
democracy
without
an
army
. . O

Questioned
in
Washington
about
what
would
happen
if
his
much
peace
plan
would
fail
, , O
President
Arias
voiced
expectations
of
direct
U
action
. . O

A
poll
conducted
in
July
by
a
Gallup
affiliate
showed
that
64
% NN
of
Costa
Ricans
believe
that
if
their
country
is
militarily
attacked
by
either
Nicaragua
or
Panama
, , O
the
U
will
come
to
its
defense
. . O

But
in
the
light
of
events
in
Panama
, , O
where
the
U
has
such
clear
strategic
interests
, , O
waiting
for
the
Delta
Force
may
prove
to
be
a
dangerous
gambit
. . O

Mr
Daremblum
is
a
lawyer
and
a
columnist
for
La
Nacion
newspaper
. . O

Holiday
Corp
said
net
income
jumped
89
% NN
, , O
partly
on
the
strength
of
record
operating
income
in
its
gaming
division
. . O

Separately
, , O
the
hotel
and
gambling
giant
said
it
was
proceeding
with
plans
to
make
a
tender
offer
and
solicit
consents
with
respect
to
approximately
$ $ I
1
billion
of
its
publicly
traded
debt
. . O

That
debt
is
part
of
the
$ $ I
2
billion
of
Holiday
debt
that
Bass
PLC
of
Britain
said
it
would
retire
or
assume
when
it
agreed

, , O
a

earlier
. . O

Results
for
the

included
$ $ B
19

in
pretax
gains
from
property
transactions
, , O
including
the
sale
of
one
Embassy
Suites
hotel
, , O
and
$ $ B
3
million
of
nonrecurring
costs
associated
with
the
acquisition
of
the
Holiday
Inn
business
by
Bass
. . O

Holiday
said
operating
income
related
to
gaming
increased
4
% NN
to
a
record
$ $ I
61
million
from
$ $ B
58
million
a
year
earlier
. . O

The
jump
reflected
record
results
in
Las
Vegas
, , O
Nev
, , O
and
Atlantic
City
, , O
N
, , O
as
well
as
a
full
quarter
's
results
from
Harrah
's
Del
Rio
in
Laughlin
, , O
Nev
. . O

Third
revenue
rose
2
% NN
to
$ $ B
433
million
from

422

. . O

For
the
nine

fell

The
tender
offer
and
consent
solicitation
will
be
made
to
debtholders
in
December
. . O

In
effect
, , O
Holiday
is
asking
holders
for
permission
for
Bass
to
buy
their
debt
. . O

Holiday
said
Salomon
Brothers
Inc
has
been
retained
to
act
as
the
dealer
and
financial
adviser
in
connection
with
the
offer
and
solicitation

The

The
television
units

exploring
the
possibility

offering
prime
programming
to
independent

two
nights

, , O
industry
executives
say

Although
such
a
venture
would

match
the
`` `` I
fourth
network
'' '' O
created
by
News
Corp
's
Fox
Broadcasting
Co
, , O
MCA
and
Paramount
may
have
similar
ambitions

Fox
, , O
which
also
owns
six
TV
stations
, , O
provides
programs
three
nights
a
week
to
those
and
other

Paramount
Domestic

formed
a

One
broadcasting
executive
familiar

the

would

Steel
jackets
of
a
type
that
may
have
prevented
collapse
of
the
columns
of
a
1
stretch
of
the
Nimitz
Freeway
had
been
installed

a
small
test
section
of
the
double
highway
last
year
by
California
's
Department
of
Transportation

employees
familiar
with
the
project
say
. . O

The
test
project
-- : O
which
reportedly
survived
Tuesday
's
earthquake
-- : O
was
a
prelude
to
a
state
plan
to
retrofit
that
critical
section
of
the
freeway
with
the
steel
casings
. . O

State
engineers
have
made
a
preliminary
finding
that
it
was
failure
of
the
concrete
columns
, , O
wrenched
and
separated
from
the
double
roadbed
, , O
that
was
responsible
for
the
collapse

The
failure
in
Oakland
of
the
freeway
segment
known
as
the
Cypress
structure
was
the
deadliest
aspect
of
the
quake
, , O
although
officials
were
hopeful
yesterday
that
the
death
toll
there
might
be
significantly
lower
than
the
250
initially
feared
. . O

Sorting
out
the
wreckage
is
expected
to
take
several
days

Red
tractors
gingerly
picked
at
the
rubble
while
jackhammers
tried
to
break
up
some
of
the
massive
slabs
of
concrete
. . O

Giant
yellow
cranes
were
wheeled
up
alongside
the
collapsed
segment
, , O
preparing
to
lift
off
chunks
of
the
debris
. . O

In
Sacramento
, , O
a
transportation
department
spokesman
said
he
could
n
immediately
confirm
or
deny
existence
of
the
test
work
. . O

However
, , O
he
asserted
that
the
department
had
n
mastered
the
technology
needed
to
retrofit
the
entire
Cypress
structure
. . O

Moreover
, , O
other
officials
noted
, , O
snafus
in
transportation
funding
that
the
state
has
experienced
over
the
years
may
have
restricted
the
availability
of
funds
for
such
a
retrofitting
, , O
even
if
it
were
technologically
feasible
. . O

Knowledgeable
employees
said
the
retrofitting
, , O
which
had
n
yet
been
budgeted
, , O
was
part
of
a
planned
, , I
three
reinforcement
of
the
Cypress
structure
begun
by
the
California
transportation
department
several
years
ago
. . O

The
Cypress
reinforcement
project
itself
was
part
of
an
annual
effort
to
shore
up
structures
believed
vulnerable
to
earthquakes
. . O

The
state
began
such
work
after
a
1971
tremblor
in
Southern
California
, , O
when
numerous
bridges
collapsed
. . O

`` `` O
We
had
just
finished
phase
two
'' '' O
of
the
Cypress
project
that
involved
installing
a
series
of
retaining
cables
designed
to
prevent
sections
of
the
roadway
from
separating
as
a
result
of
seismic
shock
, , O
a
state
DOT
engineer
said
. . O

After
completing
installation
of
the
jackets
on
`` `` O
one
frame
'' '' O
of
the
freeway
last
year
, , O
the
state
DOT
had
sent
the
project
over
to
its
Sacramento
engineers
to
draw
up
a
final
design
. . O

Knowledgeable
employees
said
the
project
had
been
stymied
somewhat
by
`` `` O
the
difficulty
of
designing
'' '' O
the
jackets
. . O

The
procedure
involves
encasing
the
concrete
columns
with
steel
, , O
then
connecting
them
more
securely
to
the
double
roadbed
. . O

The
employees
also
said
the
project
may
have
been
snagged
by
budgetary
concerns
. . O

One
preliminary
estimate
put
the
retrofitting
cost
at
as
much
as
$ $ I
50
million
. . O

The
collapse
of
the
span
has
provoked
surprise
and
anger
among
state
officials
. . O

Gov
George
Deukmejian
, , O
who
said
he
had
been
assured
by
state
transportation
officials
that
the
structure
could
withstand
an
even
larger
quake
, , O
called
for
an
immediate
investigation
. . O

`` `` O
I
want
to
know
who
made
the
decision
that
it
was
safe
for

people
to

'' '' O
said
Richard
Katz
, , O
a
state
legislator
who
is
chairman
of
the
California
Assembly
's
transportation
committee

He
said
he
would
convene
hearings
within
two
weeks

The
Cypress
structure
opened
in
June
1957
, , O
and
as
such
, , O
like
many
buildings
in
the
San
Francisco
Bay
area
, , B

not
meet
current
building
codes
requiring
considerably
more
steel
support

The
northern
piers
of
the
span
lie
in
estuarian
deposits
that
were
of
a
type
to
have
liquefied
easily
during
the
1906
quake
. . O

Transportation
department
officials
, , O
however
, , O
said
they
were
as
surprised
as
anyone
by
the
Cypress
destruction
. . O

They
said
previous
earthquakes
suggested
that
multiple
viaducts
would
stand
up
well

although
they
were
working
on
ways
to
bolster
them

Addressing

Studies
in

yesterday

Mr
Genscher
said

`` `` O
History
will
judge
us
by
whether

have
taken

The
ultimate
aim
of
Western
support
for

he
said

is
to
create
`` `` O
an
equitable

'' '' O

Mr
Genscher
and
U
Secretary
of
Commerce
Robert

Mosbacher
, , O
in
separate
speeches
at
the
conference
, , O
appealed
for
more
Western
contributions
to
economic
reforms
and
business
development
in
Hungary
and
Poland
. . O

Bonn
and
Washington
are
leading
supporters
of
Poland
's
request
for
a
$ $ I
1
billion
stand
credit
from
the
International
Monetary
Fund

`` `` O
We

said
Mr
Mosbacher

U
curbs
on
the
exports

to
East
bloc
countries
will
remain
in

however

Meanwhile
, , O
the
U
House
of
Representatives
yesterday
approved
an
$ $ I
837
million
aid
package
for
Poland
and
Hungary
that
more
than
doubles
the
amount
President
Bush
had
requested
. . O

The
package
was
brought
to
the
House
just
15
days
after
it
was
introduced
, , O
indicating
Congress
's
eagerness
to
reward
Poland
and
Hungary
for
their
moves
toward
democracy
and
freemarket
economic
reforms
. . O

The
legislation
, , O
approved

and
sent
to
the
Senate
, , O
establishes
two
enterprise
funds

to
be
governed
by
independent
nonprofit
boards
, , O
which
will
make
loans
and
investments
in
new

The
Polish
fund
would
be
seeded
with
$ $ B
160

the
Hungarian

with

40

In

industrialized

including
the
U

coordinated
by

trade
advice

a
line
of
credit
equivalent

1

through
the
European
Investment
Bank

while

plans

When

Last
week
, , O
Bonn
agreed
to
reschedule
2
billion
marks
in
Polish
debt
that
came
due
last
year
. . O

In
addition
, , O
a
one
billion

credit
dating
from
1974
is
to
be
written
off

Poland
's
plan
to
switch
to
a
free
economy
by
1991
is
hampered
by
a
foreign
debt
load
of
$ $ B
39

. . O

West
Germany
also
has
increased
its
credit
guarantees
to
Hungary
by
500
million
marks
to
1
billion
marks
as
the
emerging
democratic
state
rushes
through
its

economic
reforms

including
a
broad
privatization
of
state
industry
and
tax
incentives
for
industrial
investment

An
additional
500
million
marks
in
credit
was
promised
by
the
West
German
state
governments

Bavaria

Deutsche

bank
to
set
up

offices
in

A
maxim
of
Frankfurt

said
the

`` `` I

Mattel
attributed
the

Hot

Mattel
said
the
company
's
sale
of
rights
to
land
and
buildings
at
its
Hawthorne
, , I
Calif
, , I
headquarters
resulted
in
a
$ $ I
13
million
charge
to
third
operating
profit
. . O

The
charge
did
n
affect
net
for
the
quarter
as
it
was
offset
by
tax
benefits

Mattel
has
purchased
a
new
headquarters
building
in
El
Segundo
, , O
Calif
, , O
which
it
will
occupy
by
the
end
of

Democracy
can
be
cruel
to
politicians
: : O
Sometimes
it
forces
them
to
make
choices
. . O

Now
that
the
Supreme
Court
opened
the
door
on
the
subject
of
abortion
, , O
politicians
are
squinting
under
the
glare
of
democratic
choice
. . O

Their
discomfort
is
a
healthy
sign
for
the
rest
of
us
. . O

Republicans
are
squinting
most
painfully
, , O
at
least
at
first
, , O
which
is
only
fair
because
they
've
been
shielded
the
most
. . O

So
long
as
abortion
was
a
question
for
litigation
, , B
not
legislation
, , O
Republicans
could
find
political
security
in
absolutism
. . O

They
could
attract
one
voters
by
adopting
the
right
movement
's
strongest
position
, , O
even
as
pro
Republicans
knew
this
mattered
little
on
an
issue
monopolized
by
the
court
. . O

Now
it
matters
. . O

Much
of
Washington
thought
it
detected
George
Bush
in
a
characteristic
waffle
on
abortion
the
past
week
. . O

Only
a
month
ago
he
'd
warned
Congress
not
to
pass
legislation
to
pay
for
abortions
in
cases
of
rape
or
incest
. . O

Last
Friday
, , O
after
Congress
passed
it
anyway
, , O
he
hinted
he
was
looking
for
compromise
. . O

Was
the
man
who
once
was
pro
, , O
but
later
pro
, , O
converting
again
? . O

In
fact
, , O
Mr
Bush
's
dance
was
more
wiggle
than
waffle
. . O

Pro
advocates
say
the
White
House
never
wavered
over
the
veto
. . O

Christopher
Smith
-LRB
R
, , O
N
-RRB
, , O
a
pro
leader
in
the
House
, , O
suggested
a
compromise
that
would
have
adapted
restrictive
language
from
rape
and
incest
exceptions
in
the
states
. . O

The
White
House
, , O
never
eager
for
a
fight
, , O
was
happy
to
try
, , O
which
is
why
George
Bush
said
he
was
looking
for
`` `` O
flexibility
'' '' O
last
week
. . O

When
Democrats
refused
to
budge
, , O
pro
Republicans
met
at
the
White
House
with
Chief
of
Staff
John
Sununu
on
Monday
, , O
and
Mr
Bush
quickly
signaled
a
veto
. . O

Amid
charges
of
`` `` O
timidity
'' '' O
on
Panama
and
elsewhere
, , O
the
president
was
n
about
to
offend
his
most
energetic
constituency
. . O

The
GOP
doubters
were
in
Congress
. . O

In
last
week
's
House
vote
, , O
41
Republicans
defected
. . O

After
the
vote
, , O
Connecticut
Rep
Nancy
Johnson
rounded
up
nearly
as
many
signatures
on
a
letter
to
Mr
Bush
urging
him
not
to
veto
. . O

Even
such
a
pro
stalwart
as
Sen
Orrin
Hatch
-LRB
R
, , O
Utah
-RRB
had
counseled
some
kind
of
compromise
. . O

The
Senate
passed
the
same
bill
yesterday
, , O
with
a
veto
majority
of
67
. . O

The
manuevering
illustrates
an
emerging
Republican
donnybrook
, , O
pacified
since
the
early
1980s
. . O

At
the
1988
GOP
convention
, , O
abortion
was
barely
discussed
at
all
, , O
though
delegates
were
evenly
divided
on
the
question
of
an
anti
constitutional
amendment
. . O

Ms
Johnson
made
a
passionate
statement
to
the
platform
committee
, , O
but
she
was
talking
to
herself
. . O

Now
many
Republicans
are
listening
. . O

They
're
frightened
by
what
they
see
in
New
Jersey
, , O
and
especially
Virginia
, , O
where
pro
GOP
candidates
for
governor
are
being
pummeled
on
abortion
. . O

Eddie
Mahe
, , O
a
Republican
consultant
, , O
says
the
two
GOP
candidates
could
have
avoided
trouble
if
they
had
framed
the
issue
first
. . O

-LRB
In
Virginia
, , O
Marshall
Coleman
and
his
running
mate
, , O
Eddy
Dalton
, , O
are
both
on
the
defensive
for
opposing
abortions
even
in
cases
of
rape
or
incest
. . O
-RRB

But
Mr
Mahe
adds
, , O
`` `` O
The
net
loser
in
the
next
few
years
is
the
right
side
. . O
'' '' O

Darla
St
Martin
, , O
of
the
National
Right
to
Life
Committee
, , O
says
exit
polls
from
the
1988
election
had
single
, , I
pro
voters
giving
Mr
Bush
about
five
more
percentage
points
of
support
than
pro
voters
gave
Michael
Dukakis
. . O

But
the
Supreme
Court
's
opening
of
debate
may
have
changed
even
that
. . O

GOP
pollster
Neil
Newhouse
, , O
of
the
Wirthlin
Group
, , O
says
polls
this
summer
showed
that
the
single
voters
had
about
evened
out
. . O

Polls
are
no
substitute
for
principle
, , O
but
they
'll
do
for
some
politicians
. . O

The
Republican
danger
is
that
abortion
could
become
for
them
what
it
's
long
been
for
Democrats
, , O
a
divisive
litmus
test
. . O

It
's
already
that
in
the
Bush
administration
, , O
at
least
for
any
job
in
which
abortion
is
even
remotely
an
issue
. . O

Oklahoma
official
Robert
Fulton
lost
a
chance
for
a
senior
job
in
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
after
right
activists
opposed
him
. . O

Caldwell
Butler
, , O
a
conservative
former
congressman
, , O
was
barred
from
a
Legal
Services
post
, , O
after
he
gave
wrong
answers
on
abortion
. . O

Even
the
president
's
doctor
, , O
Burton
Lee
, , O
has
said
on
the
record
that
he
'd
love
to
be
surgeon
general
but
could
n
pass
the
pro
test
. . O

In
the
case
of
HHS
Secretary
Louis
Sullivan
, , O
the
litmus
test
could
yet
damage
issues
important
to
other
parts
of
the
Republican
coalition
. . O

After
Mr
Sullivan
waffled
on
abortion
last
year
, , O
the
White
House
appeased
right
by
surrounding
him
with
pro
deputies
. . O

Their
views
on
health
care
and
welfare
did
n
much
matter
, , O
though
HHS
spends
billions
a
year
on
both
. . O

It
makes
only
a
handful
of
abortion
decisions
. . O

Though
Democrats
can
gloat
at
all
this
for
now
, , O
they
may
want
to
contain
their
glee
. . O

On
abortion
, , O
their
own
day
will
come
. . O

Eventually
even
Republicans
will
find
a
way
to
frame
the
issue
in
ways
that
expose
pro
absolutism
. . O

Does
the
candidate
favor
parental
consent
for
teen
abortions
? . O

-LRB
The

-RRB
What
about
banning
abortions
in
the
second

third
trimesters

-LRB
The

says
no

-RRB

Democracy
is
forcing
the
abortion
debate
toward
healthy
compromise
, , O
toward
the
unpolarizing
middle
. . O

Roe

political
debate

so
the
extremes
blossomed

Now
the
ambivalent
middle

is
reasserting
itself

Within

that

will
be

But
because
of
the
uncertainty
of
the
outcome
of

suit
, , O
Mr
Conner

done
little
to

'' '' O
said
Dana
Smith

The

, , O
Mr
Smith
said
, , O
and
the

's
budget
could
easily
reach
$ $ B
30
million
. . O

But
spokesmen
for
both
Mr
Isler

Mr
Conner
say
the
formation
of
the
new

has
to
do
with
Mr
Isler

desire
to
skipper
his
own
team

begin
planning
now

rather
than
any
falling
out

Missouri

writing
in
the
fall
issue
of
the
Heritage
Foundation
's
Policy
Review
about
the
proposed
location
of
a
hazardous
incinerator
in
his
county
: : O

Of
course
I
'd
rather
have
a
computer
software
firm
in
my
backyard
than
a
hazardous
waste
incinerator
. . O

But
I
'd
also
rather
live
next
door
to
an
incinerator
than
to
some
of
the
hog
farms
I
've
seen
-LRB
and
smelt
-RRB
in
these
parts
. . O

An
incinerator
is
also
probably
better
than
having
nobody
next
door
-- : O
on
our
farm
there
are
four
unoccupied
houses
. . O

On
my
four
drive
to
farm
headquarters
each
morning
, , O
I
drive
by
another
four
empty
houses
. . O

A
community
of
abandoned
farmsteads
, , O
failing
businesses
, , O
and
crumbling
roads
and
bridges
is
hardly
a
desirable
one
... : O
. . O

The
loss
of
40
jobs
by
a
depressed
county
in
rural
Missouri
is
hardly
of
national
importance
except
for
this
: : O
If
the
most
environmentally
safe
way
of
dealing
with
a
national
problem
can
not
be
built
in
Atchinson
County
, , O
what
hope
have
we
for
dealing
with
the
wastes
our
economy
produces
? . O

After
all
, , O
farmers
here
work
with
`` `` B
hazardous
'' '' I
chemicals
every
day
, , O
many
of
them
the
same
chemicals
that
would
have
been
destroyed
in
the
incinerator
. . O

We
know
they
are
dangerous
, , O
but
if
handled
with
care
, , O
their
benefits
far
outweigh
any
risk
to
the
environment
. . O

Just
because
Stamford
, , I
Conn
, , I
High
School
did
nothing
when
its
valuable
1930s
mural
was
thrown
in
the
trash
does
n
mean
the
city
no
longer
owns
the
work
of
art
, , O
a
federal
judge
ruled
. . O

The
mural
, , O
now
valued
at
$ $ B
1
million
according
to
appraisers
, , O
was
tossed
in
a
trash
heap
in
1971
by
workers
who
were
renovating
the
building
. . O

The
100
mural
, , O
painted
by
James
Daugherty
in
1934
, , O
was
commissioned
by
the
federal
Works
Project
Administration
. . O

After
the
discarded
mural
was
found
outside
the
school
by
a
concerned
Stamford
graduate
, , O
it
eventually
was
turned
over
to
Hiram
Hoelzer
, , O
a
professional
art
restorer
. . O

Throughout
the
1970s
, , O
Stamford
school
and
city
officials
made
no
effort
to
locate
the
mural
. . O

Apparently
the
officials
did
n
even
know
the
mural
was
missing
until
1980
, , O
when
a
researcher
found
that
the
painting
was
in
Mr
Hoelzer
's
studio
and
questioned
school
officials
about
it
. . O

In
1986
, , O
Stamford
officials
thanked
Mr
Hoelzer
for
taking
care
of
the
mural
-- : O
and
demanded
he
return
it
as
soon
as
possible
. . O

Mr
Hoelzer
, , O
however
, , O
sued
Stamford
, , O
claiming
that
the
city
had
abandoned
the
artwork
and
that
it
had
waited
too
long
to
reclaim
it
. . O

But
Judge
Louis
L
Stanton
of
federal
court
in
Manhattan
ruled
that
the
city
could
n
be
faulted
for
waiting
too
long
because
it
did
n
realize
until
1986
that
its
ownership
of
the
painting
was
in
dispute
. . O

The
judge
also
ruled
that
the
painting
was
n
abandoned
because
officials
did
n
intend
for
it
to
be
thrown
away
and
were
unaware
that
the
workmen
had
discarded
it
. . O

Mr
Hoelzer
did
n
return
phone
calls
seeking
comment
on
the
judge
's
decision
. . O

The
judge
ordered
that
a
hearing
be
held
Nov
17
to
determine
how
much
the
city
should
pay
Mr
Hoelzer
for
his
services
. . O

Mary
E
Sommer
, , O
corporate
counsel
for
Stamford
, , O
said
the
city
has
discussed
several
possible
plans
for
displaying
the
mural
, , O
which
portrays
various
scenes
from
the
Great
Depression
. . O

She
said
the
mural
`` `` O
preserves
an
era
in
Stamford
and
in
our
country
when
this
type
of
work
was
being
done
. . O

The
prices
of
corn
futures
contracts
jumped
amid
rumors
that
the
Soviet
Union
is
keeping
up
its
dizzying
October
buying
binge
of
U
corn
. . O

Those
rumors
were
confirmed
after
the
end
of
trading
yesterday
when
the
U
Agriculture
Department
announced
that
the
Soviets
had
bought
1
million
metric
tons
of
U
corn
, , O
bringing
their
U
corn
purchases
confirmed
so
far
this
month
to
about
five
million
metric
tons
. . O

In
trading
at
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
, , O
the
corn
contract
for
December
delivery
jumped
5
cents
a
bushel
to
settle
at
$ $ B
2
a
bushel
. . O

The
Soviet
purchases
are
close
to
exceeding
what
some
analysts
had
expected
the
Soviet
Union
to
buy
this
fall
, , O
the
season
in
which
it
usually
buys
much
of
the
corn
it
imports
from
the
U
. . O

That
pace
is
causing
some
analysts
to
speculate
that
the
Soviet
Union
might
soon
purchase
as
much
as
another
two
million
metric
tons
. . O

One
sign
that
more
Soviet
purchases
are
possible
is
that
U
grain
companies
yesterday
bought
an
unusually
large
amount
of
corn
futures
contracts
. . O

That
sometimes
signals
that
they
are
laying
plans
to
export
corn
. . O

By
some
estimates
, , O
several
grain
companies
combined
bought
contracts
for
the
possession
of
roughly
one
million
metric
tons
of
corn
. . O

By
buying
futures
contracts
, , O
these
companies
attempt
to
protect
themselves
from
swings
in
the
price
of
the
corn
that
they
are
obligated
to
deliver
. . O

Rumors
of
Soviet
interest
also
pushed
up
the
prices
of
soybean
futures
contracts
. . O

Among
other
things
, , O
the
Agriculture
Department
is
widely
thought
to
be
mulling
whether
to
subsidize
the
sale
of
soybean
oil
to
the
Soviet
Union
. . O

On
top
of
all
this
, , O
corn
and
soybean
prices
rose
on
reports
that
the
Midwest
harvest
was
disrupted
by
a
freakishly
early
snow
storm
that
dumped
several
inches
in
parts
of
Indiana
and
Ohio
. . O

The
harvest
delays
, , O
however
, , O
are
expected
to
be
temporary
. . O

Balmy
temperatures
are
forecast
for
next
week
, , O
said
Robert
Lekberg
, , O
an
analyst
at
Farmers
Grain
& CC
Livestock
Corp
, , O
Chicago
. . O

Many
farmers
used
the
jump
in
prices
to
sell
their
recently
harvested
crop
to
grain
elevator
companies
. . O

The
heavy
selling
by
farmers
helped
to
damp
the
price
rally
. . O

Wheat
futures
prices
rose
slightly
. . O

In
other
commodity
markets
yesterday
: : O

PRECIOUS

A

One
price
development
was
the
lower
increase
of
only
0
% NN
in
the
consumer
price
index
for
September
, , O
an
analyst
said
. . O

He
noted
that
the
`` `` I
core
inflation
rate
, , O
'' '' O
which
excludes
food
and
energy
, , O
was
also
low
at
0

Other
news
that
weighed
on
the
market
: : O
Initial

American
Telephone

any

demand

; : O
and
the
dollar
strengthened
during
the
day
, , O
putting
pressure
on
gold
. . O

Also
, , O
the
analyst
said
, , O
economic
circumstances
are
such
that
both
South
Africa
and
the
Soviet
Union
, , O
the
principal
gold
and
platinum
producers

are
being
forced
to
continue
selling
the

Both
are
in
great
need
of
foreign
exchange

and
South
Africa
is
also
under
pressure
to
meet
foreign
loan
commitments
, , O
he
said

`` `` O
Putting
it
all
together

COPPER

Futures
prices

in
quiet
trading
. . O

The
December
contract
rose
1
cents
a
pound
to
$ $ B
1
. . O

That
contract
fell
a
total
of
5
cents
during
the
first
three
days
of
this
week
, , O
mostly
in
reaction
to
last
Friday
's
stock
market
plunge
, , O
which
prompted
concern
that
it
might
signal
a
similar
sharp
slowing
of
the
U
economy
and
thus
reduced
demand
for
copper
, , O
a
leading
industrial
metal
. . O

In
recent
days
, , O
however
, , O
there
has
been
increased
purchasing
of
copper
in
London
, , O
an
analyst
said
. . O

Some
of
this
buying
was
by
Japan
, , O
which
has
had
its
supplies
sharply
reduced
by
long
production
stoppages
at
the
Bougainville
mine
in
Papua
New
Guinea
, , O
Highland
Valley
mine
in
British
Columbia
, , O
and
the
Cananea
mine
in
Mexico
, , O
which
are
major
shippers
to
Japan
. . O

The
increasing
likelihood
that
Cananea
and
Highland
Valley
will
soon
return
to
production
may
have
cut
some
of
that
purchasing
, , O
but
even
if
any
of
these
mines
begin
operating
soon
, , O
their
output
wo
n
be
significant
until
at
least
the
end
of
the
year
, , O
analysts
note
. . O

So
, , O
one
analyst
said
, , O
even
though
the
long
production
problems
may
be
easing
, , O
there
will
still
be
a
significant
need
for
copper
over
the
next
three
months
, , O
when
inventories
will
remain
relatively
low

Melvin
Belli
's
San
Francisco
law
offices
may
have
been
the
epicenter
of
legal
activity
after
Tuesday
's
earthquake
. . O

In
the
first
25
minutes
after
his
office
's
telephone
service
was
restored
yesterday
morning
, , O
17
potential
clients
had
called
seeking
the
services
of
the
self
King
of
Torts
. . O

Mr
Belli
, , O
like
many
other
personal
lawyers
, , O
suspects
that
the
earthquake
, , O
which
measured
6
on
the
Richter
scale
, , O
will
generate
enough
lawsuits
to
keep
this
city
's
personal
and
construction
lawyers
busy
for
quite
some
time
. . O

Suits
are
likely
to
be
filed
against
engineering
firms
, , O
contractors
and
developers
, , O
as
well
as
against
local
agencies
. . O

But
lawyers
looking
to
cash
in
on
the
quake
may
have
a
tough
time
once
their
cases
reach
a
judge
. . O

Experts
on
California
tort
law
say
protections
afforded
government
agencies
in
such
cases
are
pretty
ironclad
. . O

Even
claims
against
individuals
and
companies
face
significant
roadblocks
. . O

The
major
legal
barrier
is
the
principle
that
no
one
can
be
held
liable
for
an
`` `` I
act
of
God
. . O
'' '' O

For
now
, , O
says
Laurence
Drivon
, , O
president
of
the
6
California
Trial
Lawyers
Association
, , O
`` `` O
the
last
thing
we
really
need
to
worry
about
is
whether
anybody
is
going
to
get
sued
, , O
or
whether
they
have
liability
or
not
. . O

We
still
have
people
wandering
around
in
a
daze
in
San
Francisco
worrying
about
whether
it
's
going
to
rain
tonight
. . O
'' '' O

But
that
wo
n
stop
plaintiffs
' POS
lawyers
from
seeking
a
little
room
for
maneuvering
. . O

In
San
Francisco
, , O
they
argue
, , O
an
earthquake
was
a
near
certainty
. . O

Therefore
, , O
engineering
firms
, , I
construction
contractors
and
developers
can
be
sued
for
not
keeping
structures
up
to
standard
, , O
and
government
agencies
can
be
held
accountable
for
failing
to
properly
protect
citizens
from
such
a
foreseeable
disaster
, , O
if
negligence
can
be
proven
. . O

`` `` O
My
prediction
is
there
will
be
mass
litigation
over
errors
and
omissions
in
engineering
and
contracting
, , O
'' '' O
says
Stanley
Chesley
, , O
a
well
Cincinnati
plaintiffs
lawyer
. . O

From
what
he
saw
on
television
, , O
Mr
Chesley
points
out
that
Interstate
880
, , O
which
collapsed
and
killed
more
than
200
commuters
, , O
suffered
serious
damage
while
surrounding
buildings
appeared
to
sustain
no
damage
whatsoever
. . O

He
adds
that
`` `` O
they
were
aware
of
the
propensity
for
earthquakes
and
the
San
Andreas
Fault
. . O
'' '' O

The
flamboyant
and
publicity
Mr
Belli
says
he
already
has
investigators
looking
into
who
could
be
held
liable
for
the
damage
on
the
Bay
Bridge
and
the
interstate
approaching
it
. . O

`` `` O
We
wo
n
know
until
the
smoke
clears
-- : O
but
yes
, , O
we
're
looking
into
it
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
. . O

Mr
Belli
says
he
wants
to
know
whether
state
or
federal
engineers
or
private
companies
could
have
prevented
the
damage
. . O

Mr
Belli
, , O
who
was
at
Candlestick
Park
for
the
World
Series
Tuesday
night
, , O
says
he
has
hired
civil
engineers
to
check
out
his
own
mildly
damaged
building
and
to
investigate
the
bridge
collapse
. . O

Defense
lawyers
, , O
perhaps
understandably
, , O
say
that
plaintiffs
' POS
lawyers
taking
such
an
approach
will
have
little
success
in
pursuing
their
claims
, , O
though
they
add
that
the
facts
of
each
case
must
be
looked
at
individually
. . O

`` `` O
A
lot
of
this
is
going
to
be
code

'' '' O
says
Ignazio
J
Ruvolo
, , O
a
construction
law
specialist
at
Bronson
, , I
Bronson
& CC
McKinnon
, , O
a
San
Francisco
law
firm
. . O

Plaintiffs
, , O
he
says
, , O
will
argue
that
damaged
structures
were
n
built
to
proper
design
standards
. . O

But
if
defendants
can
prove
that
they
met
San
Francisco
's
stringent
building
codes
, , O
`` `` O
that
's
probably
going
to
protect
them
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Ruvolo
says
. . O

Government
entities
, , O
continues
Mr
Ruvolo
, , O
could
be
protected
by
the
California
Government
Tort
Liability
Act

Under
the
statute

agencies
are
provided
`` `` O
defenses
that
normally

Mr

`` `` O
The
legislature

not

Built
into
the
statute
are

immunities

which

a

California
Department
of
Transportation

which
oversees
the
damaged
Bay

The
state
is
protected
when

structures
were
approved
ahead
of

or
when

met
previously
approved
standards

says
Mr

He
believes
those
defenses
might

apply
to
the
Bay
Bridge
collapse

Nevertheless

he
adds

`` `` O
I
would

shocked

If

Mr

In

What
's
in
a
name
? . O

Apparently
a
lot
, , O
according
to
the
British
firm
of
Deloitte
, , I
Haskins
& CC
Sells
. . O

The
British
firm
has
begun
court
proceedings
in

to
prevent
the
use

by
Deloitte
, , I
Haskins

Sells
and
Touche
Ross
& CC

in
England

the
rest

The
British
Deloitte
firm
recently
withdrew
from
the
merger
of
Deloitte
and
Touche
world
and
joined
Coopers
& CC
Lybrand
. . O

John
Bullock
, , O
senior
partner
of
Deloitte
in
the
U
, , O
said
`` `` O
the
decision
to
start
these
proceedings
has
n
been
taken
lightly
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Bullock
said
the
British
firm
has
used
the
name
`` `` I
Deloitte
'' '' O
since
1845
. . O

In
the
U
, , O
Deloitte
, , I
Haskins
& CC
Sells
was
known
as
Haskins
& CC
Sells
until
1978
, , O
when
it
added
the
`` `` I
Deloitte
'' '' I
name
of
its
British
affiliate
. . O

John
C
Burton
, , O
an
accounting
professor
at
Columbia
University
's
Graduate
School
of
Business

said
`` `` O
there
's
a

long
history

in
England
, , O
where
accounting
predates
the
U

'' '' O

Although
accountants
are

noted
as
`` `` O

deeply
emotional

they
really
hold
it
all

J
Michael
Cook

chairman
of

Haskins

Sells
International

said
he
believes
the
legal
action
by
the
British

`` `` O
to
be
without
merit

'' '' O

Mr
Cook
said
that
last
June
, , O
the
international
executive
committes
of
Deloitte
and
Touche
agreed
to
a
world
merger

`` `` O
The

proceeding
according

except
as
to
the
withdrawal
of
the
Deloitte
U
firm

'' '' O
he
said
. . O

Partners
at
other
accounting
firms
say
that
the
Deloitte
firm
in
the
U
is
filing
the
suit
to
get
even
with
the
merged
Deloitte
firm
for
keeping
major
auditing
work
in
England
. . O

General
Motors
Corp
, , O
a
Deloitte
audit
client
, , O
for
example
, , O
has
agreed
to
keep
its
annual
$ $ I
18
million
world
audit
and
associated
tax
work
with
the
merged
Deloitte
firm
, , O
to
be
known
as
Deloitte
& CC
Touche
in
the
U
. . O

In
England
, , O
this
would
mean
that
the
British
Deloitte
would
lose
revenue
for
its
audit
of
GM
's
Vauxhill
unit
. . O

The
defection
of
Deloitte
's
affiliates
in
Britain
and
the
Netherlands
to
Coopers

Lybrand
will
make
Coopers
one
of
the
biggest
accounting
firms
in
Europe

rivaling
KPMG

there

Although
Coopers
has

been
courted
by
other
major
accounting
firms
for
a
merger

it
is
benefiting
greatly
from
fallout
from
the
Deloitte

In

Harris
Amhowitz

said
Coopers
`` `` O

`` `` O

`` `` O

that

Mr

the

have
impeded

for
building
more
federal

ease
Washington

But
other
Bush
administration
officials
have
criticized
Maryland
Gov
William
Schaefer
for
blocking
the
use
of
possible
sites
in

state

Administration
officials
also
have
said
that
Washington

In

to
Mr

released
yesterday
, , O
Washington
's
city
administrator
, , O
Carol
Thompson
, , O
complained
that
the
drug
czar
had
exaggerated
the
amount
of
federal
drug
assistance
provided
to
the
capital
. . O

Referring
to
Mr
Bennett
's
claim
that
the
federal
government
would
provide
$ $ B
97
million
in
emergency
federal
support

Ms
Thompson
wrote

`` `` O
Our

Of
his
successes

Mr
Bennett
stressed
that
existing
federal

taken
custody

375
local
inmates

He
also
noted
that
the
federal
Drug

since
April
for
106
arrests

more
than

What
if

In
the
wake
of
the
earthquake
in
California

the
devastation
of
Hurricane
Hugo
, , O
many
companies
in

areas
are
pondering
the
question

in

earthquake
zones

are
dusting
off
their
evacuation
plans

checking
food
stocks
and
reminding
employees
of
what
to
do
if
emergency
strikes
. . O

Others
say
they
feel
confident
that
steps
they
've
already
taken
would
see
them
through
a
disaster
. . O

Preparedness
involves
more
than
flashlights
and
fire
alarms
these
days
. . O

Some
big
companies
have
teams
of
in
experts
focusing
on
safety
and
business
resumption

Many
companies
in
the
path
of
potential
disaster
have
set
up
contingency
offices
in
safe
regions
, , O
hoping
they
can
transport
employees
there
and
resume
operations
quickly

That
means
making
sure
that
copies
of
vital
computer
software

company
records
are
out

way

Some

they
would
be

`` `` O

`` `` O
It

such
as
solid
shoes

`` `` O
heavy

It
also

be

office
items
that
could
be
used
for

Among
the
suggestions

should
report

belief
that

The

reflected
the
expense

`` `` I

In

more
than

As

Prior

the
pattern
was
nearly
the
opposite

What
accounts

A

on
three
assumptions
: : O

1
-RRB
Voters
can
`` `` I
buy
'' '' O
one
of
two
brands
when
they
select
their
political
agents
-- : O
a
Republican
brand
that
believes
in
the
minimalist
state
and
in
the
virtues
of
private
markets
over
the
vices
of
public
action
, , O
and
a
Democratic
brand
that
believes
in
big
government
and
in
public
intervention
to
remedy
the
excesses
attendant
to
the
pursuit
of
private
interest
. . O

2
-RRB
Congressional
representatives
have
two
basic
responsibilities
while
voting
in
office
-- : O
dealing
with
national
issues
-LRB
programmatic
actions
such
as
casting
roll
call
votes
on
legislation
that
imposes
costs
and
confers
benefits
on
the
population
at
large
-RRB
and
attending
to
local
issues
-LRB
constituency
service
and
pork
barrel
-RRB
. . O

3
-RRB
Republican
congressional
representatives
, , O
because
of
their
belief
in
a
minimalist
state
, , O
are
less
willing
to
engage
in
local
benefit
than
are
Democratic
members
of
Congress
. . O

If
these
assumptions
hold
, , O
voters
in
races
for
Congress
face
what
in
economic
theory
is
called
a
prisoner
's
dilemma
and
have
an
incentive
, , O
at
the
margin
, , O
to
lean
Democratic
. . O

If
they
put
a
Republican
into
office
, , O
not
only
will
they
acquire
less
in
terms
of
local
benefits
but
their
selected
legislator
will
be
relatively
powerless
to
prevent
other
legislators
from
`` `` O
bringing
home
the
bacon
'' '' O
to
their
respective
constituencies
. . O

Each
legislator
, , O
after
all
, , O
is
only
one
out
of
535
when
it
comes
to
national
policy
making
. . O

In
races
for
the
White
House
, , O
a
voter
's
incentive
, , O
at
the
margin
, , O
is
to
lean
Republican
. . O

Although
a
GOP
president
may
limit
local
benefits
to
the
voter
's
particular
district
, , O
such
a
president
is
also
likely
to
be
more
effective
at
preventing
other
districts
and
their
legislators
from
bringing
home
the
local
benefits
. . O

The
individual
voter
's
standing
consequently
will
be
enhanced
through
lower
taxes
. . O

While
this
theory
is
exceedingly
simple
, , O
it
appears
to
explain
several
things
. . O

First
, , O
why
ticket
splitting
has
increased
and
taken
the
peculiar
pattern
that
it
has
over
the
past
half
century
: : O
Prior
to
the
election
of
Franklin
Roosevelt
as
president
and
the
advent
of
the
New
Deal
, , O
government
occupied
a
much
smaller
role
in
society
and
the
prisoner
's
dilemma
problem
confronting
voters
in
races
for
Congress
was
considerably
less
severe
. . O

Second
, , O
it
explains
why
voters
hold
Congress
in
disdain
but
generally
love
their
own
congressional
representatives
: : O
Any
individual
legislator
's
constituents
appreciate
the
specific
benefits
that
the
legislator
wins
for
them
but
not
the
overall
cost
associated
with
every
other
legislator
doing
likewise
for
his
own
constituency
. . O

Third
, , O
the
theory
suggests
why
legislators
who
pay
too
much
attention
to
national
policy
making
relative
to
local
benefit
have
lower
security
in
office
. . O

For
example
, , O
first
members
of
the
House
, , O
once
the
most
vulnerable
of
incumbents
, , O
have
become
virtually
immune
to
defeat
. . O

The
one
exception
to
this
recent
trend
was
the
defeat
of
13
of
the
52
freshman
Republicans
brought
into
office
in
1980
by
the
Reagan
revolution
and
running
for
re
in
1982
. . O

Because
these
freshmen
placed
far
more
emphasis
on
their
partisan
role
-- : O
spreading
the
Reagan
revolution
-- : O
in
national
policy
making
, , O
they
were
more
vulnerable
to
defeat
. . O

Fourth
, , O
the
theory
indicates
why
the
Republican
Party
may
have
a
difficult
time
attracting
viable
candidates
for
congressional
office
. . O

Potential
candidates
may
be
discouraged
from
running
less
by
the
congressional
salary
than
by
the
prospect
of
defeat
at
the
hands
of
a
Democratic
opponent
. . O

To
the
extent
that
potential
Republican
candidates
and
their
financial
backers
realize
that
the
congressional
prisoner
's
dilemma
game
works
to
their
disadvantage
, , O
the
Republican
Party
will
be
hindered
in
its
attempts
to
field
a
competitive
slate
of
congressional
candidates
. . O

Fifth
, , O
the
theory
may
provide
at
least
a
partial
reason
for
why
ticket
splitting
has
been
particularly
pronounced
in
the
South
. . O

To
the
extent
that
Democratic
legislators
from
the
South
have
held
a
disproportionate
share
of
power
in
Congress
since
1932
and
have
been
able
to
translate
such
clout
into
relatively
more
local
benefits
for
their
respective
constituencies
, , O
voters
in
the
South
have
had
an
especially
strong
incentive
to
keep
such
Democrats
in
office
. . O

Finally
, , O
the
theory
suggests
why
Republicans
generally
have
fared
better
in
Senate
races
than
in
campaigns
for
the
House
. . O

Since
local
benefit
matters
more
and
national
policy
making
matters
less
in
the
lower
chamber
of
Congress
, , O
this
is
precisely
the
pattern
one
would
expect
if
Republicans
are
less
willing
to
engage
in
local
benefit
than
their
Democratic
counterparts
. . O

Is
there
any
empirical
support
for
this
theory
? . O

Three
pieces
of
evidence
corroborate
the
key
assumption
that
Democratic
legislators
are
more
willing
to
engage
in
local
benefit
than
their
Republican
colleagues
. . O

First
, , O
economists
James
Bennett
and
Thomas
DiLorenzo
find
that
GOP
senators
turn
back
roughly
10
% NN
more
of
their
allocated
personal
staff
budgets
than
Democrats
do
. . O

To
the
extent
that
the
primary
duty
of
personal
staff
involves
local
benefit
, , O
this
indicates
that
political
philosophy
leads
congressional
Republicans
to
pay
less
attention
to
narrow
constituent
concerns
. . O

Second
, , O
if
the
key
assumption
is
valid
, , O
Democrats
should
have
lower
attendance
rates
on
roll
votes
than
Republicans
do
to
the
extent
that
such
votes
reflect
national
policy
making
and
that
participating
in
such
votes
takes
away
from
the
time
a
legislator
could
otherwise
devote
to
local
benefit
. . O

This
is
indeed
what
the
data
indicate
, , O
particularly
in
the
case
of
the
House
. . O

The
Democratic
House
attendance
rate
has
not
exceeded
the
Republican
House
attendance
rate
since
1959
. . O

Finally
, , O
as
shown
in
the
table
, , O
Democrats
allocate
a
higher
proportion
of
their
personal
staffs
to
district
offices
-- : O
where
local
benefit
duties
matter
more
and
national
policy
making
activities
matter
less
relative
to
Washington
offices
. . O

An
examination
of
changes
in
personal
staffing
decisions
in
the
Senate
between
1986
and
1987
-LRB
when
control
of
that
body
changed
party
hands
-RRB
, , O
moreover
, , O
reveals
that
the
personal
staffing
differences
noted
in
the
table
can
not
be
attributed
to
the
disproportionate
control
Democrats
exercise
, , O
due
to
their
majority
status
, , O
over
other
resources
such
as
committee
staff
. . O

An
additional
piece
of
evidence
from
the
Senate
: : O
Holding
other
factors
constant
, , O
such
as
incumbency
advantages
and
regional
factors
, , O
the
difference
between
popular
votes
for
Republican
presidential
and
senatorial
candidates
in
states
conducting
a
Senate
election
turns
out
to
be
a
positive
function
of
how
onerous
the
federal
government
's
tax
burden
is
per
state
-LRB
a
progressive
tax
rate
hits
higher
states
harder
-RRB
. . O

Put
more
simply
, , O
GOP
candidates
for
president
are
looked
on
more
kindly
by
voters
than
Republican
candidates
for
the
Senate
when
the
prisoner
's
dilemma
is
more
severe
. . O

Moreover
, , O
ticket
splitting
appears
to
take
the
same
peculiar
pattern
at
the
state
government
level
as
it
does
at
the
federal
level
. . O

State
government
is
more
typically
split
along
Republican
lines
than
the
reverse
. . O

A
cross
econometric
investigation
, , O
furthermore
, , O
reveals
that
, , O
holding
other
factors
constant
, , O
the
difference
between
a
state
's
major
vote
going
to
the
Republican
gubernatorial
candidate
and
the
Republican
share
of
the
lower
state
house
is
a
positive
function
of
the
state
tax
rate
. . O

In
sum
, , O
at
both
the
federal
and
state
government
levels
at
least
part
of
the
seemingly
irrational
behavior
voters
display
in
the
voting
booth
may
have
an
exceedingly
rational
explanation
. . O

Mr
Zupan
teaches
at
the
University
of
Southern
California
's
business
school
. . O

A
House
conference
approved
a
nearly
$ $ I
17
billion
State
, , I
Justice
and
Commerce
Department
bill
that
makes
federal
reparations
for
Japanese
held
in
World
War
II
internment
camps
a
legal
entitlement
after
next
Oct
1
. . O

The
measure
provides
no
money
for
the
promised
payments
until
then
, , O
but
beginning
in
fiscal
1991
, , O
the
government
would
be
committed
to
meeting
annual
payments
of
as
much
as
$ $ I
500
million
until
the
total
liability
of
approximately
$ $ I
1
billion
is
paid
. . O

The
action
abandons
earlier
efforts
to
find
offsetting
cuts
to
fund
the
payments
, , O
but
is
widely
seen
as
a
more
realistic
means
of
expediting
reparations
first
authorized
in
1988
. . O

The
action
came
as
Congress
sent
to
President
Bush
a
fiscal
1990
bill
providing
an
estimated
$ $ I
156
billion
for
the
Departments
of
Labor
, , O
Education
, , O
Health
and
Human
Services
. . O

Final
approval
was
on
a
67
roll
call
in
the
Senate
, , O
which
sets
the
stage
for
a
veto
confrontation
with
Mr
Bush
over
the
issue
of
publicly
financed
abortions
for
poor
women
. . O

Reversing
an
eight
federal
policy
, , O
the
measure
supports
Medicaid
abortions
in
cases
of
rape
and
incest
, , O
but
Mr
Bush
has
so
far
refused
to
support
any
specific
exemption
beyond
instances
in
which
the
mother
's
life
is
in
danger
. . O

Mr
Bush
's
veto
power
puts
him
a
commanding
position
in
the
narrowly
divided
House
, , O
but
a
vote
to
override
his
position
could
well
pick
up
new
support
because
of
the
wealth
of
health
and
education
programs
financed
in
the
underlying
bill
. . O

The
measure
before
the
conference
yesterday
funds
the
Departments
of
State
, , I
Justice
and
Commerce
through
fiscal
1990
. . O

An
estimated
$ $ I
1
billion
is
provided
for
next
year
's
census
, , O
and
negotiators
stripped
a
Senate
rider
seeking
to
block
the
counting
of
illegal
aliens
. . O

Elsewhere
in
the
Commerce
Department
, , O
nearly
$ $ I
191
million
is
preserved
for
assistance
programs
under
the
Economic
Development
Administration
. . O

And
in
a
footnote
to
the
fall
of
House
Speaker
James
Wright
this
year
, , O
the
conference
voted
to
rescind
$ $ B
11
million
in
unspent
EDA
funds
for
a
Fort
Worth
, , I
Texas
, , I
stockyards
project
that
figured
in
ethics
charges
against
the
former
Democratic
leader
. . O

Fiscal
pressures
also
forced
the
adoption
of
new
fees
charged
by
federal
agencies
, , O
and
an
18
% NN
increase
in
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
's
budget
would
be
financed
entirely
by
an
added
$ $ I
26
million
in
filing
fees
. . O

In
an
unprecedented
step
, , O
the
measure
anticipates
another
$ $ I
30
million
in
receipts
by
having
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
charge
for
fingerprint
services
in
civil
cases
-- : O
a
change
that
is
almost
certain
to
increase
Pentagon
costs
in
processing
personnel
and
security
clearances
. . O

The
bill
does
n
include
an
estimated
$ $ I
1
billion
in
supplemental
anti
funds
for
Justice
Department
and
law
accounts
that
are
still
in
conference
with
the
House
. . O

But
yesterday
's
agreement
would
make
it
easier
for
state
governments
to
handle
the
promised
aid
by
deferring
for
one
year
a
scheduled
50
% NN
increase
in
the
required
state
matching
funds
for
law
grants
. . O

Similarly
, , O
the
measure
adjusts
the
current
funding
formula
to
promise
smaller
states
such
as
New
Hampshire
and
Delaware
a
minimum
allocation
of
$ $ B
1
million
each
in
drug
grants
, , O
or
three
times
the
current
minimum
. . O

The
odd
mix
of
departments
in
the
bill
makes
it
one
of
the
more
eclectic
of
the
annual
appropriations
measures
, , O
and
the
assorted
provisions
attached
by
lawmakers
run
from
$ $ B
1
million
for
a
fish
farm
in
Arkansas
to
a
music
festival
in
Moscow
under

His

An
estimated

321

Mr
Rudman
also
succeeded
in
attaching
language
seeking

curb

The
effective
date
of
any
new
regulations
by

cut

applaud
Mr

moment

epiphany

even

we

that
he

bill
now
being
offered
by
Indiana
Senator
Dan
Coats
. . O

The
Coats
bill
, , O
which
already
has
32
Senate
co
, , O
is
n
a
pure
line
veto
because
it
would
apply
only
to
spending
bills
. . O

Instead
it
's
a
form
of
`` `` O
enhanced
rescission
, , O
'' '' O
giving
a
President
a
chance
to
rescind
, , I
or
strike
, , O
specific
spending
items
that
just
go
too
far
. . O

Under
the
proposal
, , O
a
President
would
have
a
chance
twice
each
year
to
return
a
package
of
`` `` O
rescissions
'' '' O
to
the
Hill
-- : O
once
when
he
proposes
his
budget
and
again
after
Congress
disposes
. . O

Congress
would
have
20
days
to
reject
the
package
with
a
50
% NN
majority
, , O
but
then
a
President
could
veto
that
rejection
. . O

Congress
would
then
need
the
usual
two
majority
to
override
any
veto
. . O

The
proposal
would
restore
some
discipline
erased
from
the
budget
process
by
the
1974
Budget
`` `` I
Reform
'' '' I
Act
. . O

Before
1974
, , O
a
President
could
`` `` O
impound
, , O
'' '' O
or
refuse
to
spend
, , O
funds
appropriated
by
Congress
. . O

Presidents
Kennedy
and
Johnson
were
both
big
users
of
the
impoundment
power
, , O
but
Congress
saw
its
chance
against
a
weakened
President
Nixon
and
stripped
it
away
. . O

Today
a
President
can
still
send
up
spending
rescissions
, , O
but
they
're
meaningless
unless
Congress
has
a
guilty
conscience
and
changes
its
mind
. . O

This
is
like
asking
foxes
to
feel
remorse
about
chickens
, , O
and
naturally
rescissions
are
almost
never
approved
. . O

In
1987
, , O
President
Reagan
sent
73
rescissions
back
to
the
Hill
, , O
but
only
3
% NN
of
the
spending
total
was
approved
by
Congress
. . O

Senator
Coats
's
proposal
would
let
the
proposed
spending
cuts
take
place
automatically
unless
Congress
acts
. . O

The
Members
could
still
try
to
serve
their
constituents
with
special
goodies
, , O
but
the
police
-LRB
in
the
form
of
a
President
-RRB
would
be
there
with
a
straitjacket
if
they
really
get
crazy
, , O
as
they
do
now
. . O

Mr
Coats
plans
to
offer
his
proposal
as
an
amendment
to
a
bill
to
raise
the
federal
debt
limit
before
the
end
of
the
month
. . O

President
Bush
has
endorsed
the
idea
, , O
and
at
least
50
sitting
Senators
have
voted
to
support
enhanced
rescission
authority
in
the
past
. . O

We
're
told
Senator
Pryor
is
n
yet
a
co
, , O
but
if
he
and
his
colleagues
are
serious
about
kicking
their
compulsions
, , O
they
'll
sign
up
. . O

Business
and
civic
operations
lurched
back
toward
normalcy
here
as
congressional
officials
estimated
that
the
price
tag
for
emergency
assistance
to
earthquake
California
would
total
at
least

2

`` `` O
That

The

California

For

The

The
city

earthquake
was
uneven

San

estimated
that
damages

total
$ $ B
2

Is
an

seriously
suggesting
that
the
Khmer

should
help
govern
Cambodia
? . O

Apparently
so

There
are
no
easy
choices
in
Cambodia
, , O
but
we
ca

imagine
that
it
benefits
the
U
to
become
the
catalyst
for
an
all
process
that
could
end
in
another
round
of
horror
in
Cambodia

Now
that
Vietnam
appears
to
have
pulled
out
its
occupation
army

the
State
Department
is
talking
again
about
accepting
an
`` `` I
interim
'' '' I
coalition
government
in
the
Cambodian
capital
of
Phnom

The
coalition
would
include
the
current
Vietnamese
Hun
Sen
regime

the
two
non
resistance
groups
led
by
Son
Sann
and
Prince
Sihanouk
, , O
and
the
Khmer
Rouge

The
aim
would
be
to
end
the
guerrilla
war
for
control
of
Cambodia
by
allowing
the
Khmer
Rouge
a
small
share
of
power
. . O

The
State
Department
says
that
any
Khmer
Rouge
participation
would
have
to
be
`` `` O
minimal
. . O
'' '' O

The
usual
problem
with
including
communists
in
`` `` B
interim
'' '' I
coalition
governments
is
that
their
ideology
and
methods
require
they
squeeze
out
everyone
else
. . O

Recall
that
Nicaragua

Sandinistas
came
into
Managua
as
partners
in
a
coalition
government
with
anti
moderates

Within
two
years
, , O
the
moderates
were
exiled
or
in
prison

Nicaragua
had
gone
communist

and
the
Sandinistas
were
building
one
of
the
biggest
armies
in
Latin
America
and
threatening
their
neighbors
. . O

In
Laos
, , O
when
the
Western
powers
bowed
to
pressure
for
such
a
coalition
it
turned
out
they
were
opening
the
door
to
communist
domination

Even
Mao

China
began
in
1949
with
a
partnership
between
the
communists
and
a
number
of
smaller

non

What
complicates
the
scene
in
Cambodia
is
that
the
current
regime
is
already
communist

guerrilla
groups
. . O

It
's
not
clear
which
crew
of
communists
might
prevail
in
a
coalition
government
, , O
but
the
one
good
bet
is
that
the
non
would
disappear
. . O

That
would
leave
Hun
Sen
and
the
Khmer
Rouge
. . O

The
Hun
Sen
regime
has
sent
thousands
of
conscript
laborers
to
die
of
malaria
and
malnourishment
while
building
Cambodia
's
equivalent
of
the
Berlin
Wall
near
the
Thai
border
. . O

The
Khmer
Rouge
, , O
however
, , O
carry
an
unsurpassed
record
for
Cambodian
tyranny
. . O

These
utopians
caused
the
deaths
-- : O
by
starvation
, , I
disease
or
execution
-- : O
of
well
over
one
million
Cambodians
. . O

The
Cambodian
horror
was
so
bad
that
the
Vietnamese
occupation
in
1978
was
a
perverse
form
of
relief
. . O

The
world
might
want
to
believe
that
the
Khmer
Rouge
ca
n
still
be
such
bad
guys
, , O
just
as
in
the
late
1970s
it
was
reluctant
to
credit
the
reports
of
genocide
then
taking
place
. . O

But
there
is
no
solid
evidence
that
the
Khmer
Rouge
have
changed
. . O

Some
of
our
sources
in
Thailand
say
the
notorious
old
Khmer
Rouge
leader
, , O
Pol
Pot
, , O
has
been
holed
up
this
summer
in
Khmer
Rouge
camps
near
the
Thai
border
. . O

So
it
's
difficult
to
swallow
the
notion
that
Mr
Baker
is
willing
to
accept
conditions
that
would
help
the
Khmer
Rouge
set
up
shop
again
in
Phnom
Penh
. . O

True
, , O
Prince
Sihanouk
backs
the
idea
of
such
a
coalition
, , O
at
least
for
this
week
. . O

But
Prince
Sihanouk
has
backed
all
sorts
of
ideas
over
the
years
, , O
and
done
rather
better
by
himself
than
by
Cambodia
. . O

Nor
should
the
U
worry
much
about
offending
China
, , O
which
still
aids
the
Khmer
Rouge
. . O

It
's
time
the
State
Department
recognized
that
China
does
not
play
by
gentlemen
's
rules
. . O

For
the
U
to
lend
even
the
slightest
support
to
the
most
infamous
killers
on
Indochina
's
bleak
scene
could
only
disturb
America
's
allies
elsewhere
. . O

It
would
be
entirely
rational
for
communist
insurgents
in
countries
such
as
the
Philippines
or
Peru
to
conclude
the
following
: : O
Fight
viciously
enough
and
the
U
, , O
under
the
banner
of
pragmatism
, , O
might
eventually
help
negotiate
your
way
to
victory
. . O

U
diplomacy
has
done
it
before
, , O
and
it
will
likely
do
it
again
. . O

The
administration
and
Congress
have
lately
tangoed
around
the
idea
of
sending
military
aid
to
Cambodia
's
non
. . O

But
now
the
possibility
of
`` `` O
diplomatic
movement
'' '' O
-LRB
Vietnam
's
withdrawal
, , O
the
Baker
initiative
-RRB
has
put
that
plan
on
hold
, , O
with
the
proviso
that
if
the
going
got
rough
, , O
the
U
would
then
rearm
the
opposition
. . O

Why
the
timidity
? . O

At
the
very
least
, , O
the
odds
are
heavily
weighted
against
the
prospects
of
preventing
the
Khmer
Rouge
and
Cambodia
's
communists
from
ultimately
moving
against
their
opponents
. . O

When
that
day
comes
, , O
it
would
be
particularly
awful
to
know
that
the
United
States
sat
on
military
aid
and
deprived
these
people
of
the
means
to
settle
their
fate
with
at
least
a
little
honor

From

of
battling
banks
, , O
the
state
has
been
inundated
with
broadcast
commercials

print
advertising
campaigns
celebrating
Texans
and
castigating
outsiders

While
advertisers
have
long
appealed
to
Texans
' POS
state
pride
and
prejudices
, , O
the
latest
trend
has
been
sparked
, , O
in

by

That
has
taken
some
of

like
to
brag
that
Texas
is
the

state
that
was

it

increased

legendary
resentment

In

Chronicle

Jim
Barlow
, , O
outlanders
were
accepted
only
after

Mr

Mr

to
new
product
delays
, , O
such
as
a
laptop
scheduled
for
September
that
wo
n
be
introduced
until

Some
delays
have
been

by

shortage

micoprocessors
-- : O
notably
Intel
Corp
's
newest
chip
, , O
the
486
-- : O
but
others

Mr

concedes
the
company
was
`` `` O
definitely
too
optimistic
'' '' O
in
its
expectations

Product
delays
, , O
however
, , O
have
left
Dell
buffeted
by
harsher
competition
in
its
bread
line
of
desktop
computers
, , O
as
powerhouse
competitors
Compaq
Computer
Corp

International
Business
Machines
Corp
price
their
PCs
more
aggressively
. . O

The
result
has
been
thinner
margins
, , O
which
have
been
further
eroded
by
an
ambitious
research

development
effort
and
rapid
overseas
expansion

Analyst
James

`` `` O
in

that

Tuesday
's
earthquake
will
depress
local
real
values

term

force
companies
to
reconsider
expanding
in

relocating
to
the
Bay
Area

real
and
relocation
specialists
said

Few
specialists
said
they
expect
the
quake
to
have
much
of
an
effect
on
most
California
property
values
. . O

But
real
experts
and
brokers
said
the
quake
undoubtedly
will
drag
down
prices
in
neighborhoods
built
on
less
stable
ground
, , O
especially
in
the
Bay
Area
. . O

`` `` O
California
prices
were
already
coming
down

This
is

going
to
help

'' '' O
said
Kenneth
T
Rosen
, , O
chairman
of
the
Center
for
Real
Estate
and
Urban
Economics
at
the
University
of
California
at
Berkeley
. . O

State
housing
prices
, , O
at
a
median
$ $ I
201
, , O
have
declined
in
recent
months
because
of
potential
buyers
' POS
inability
to
afford
homes
. . O

Mr
Rosen
, , O
among
others
, , O
suggested
that
the
quake
, , O
the
strongest
since
the
1906
temblor
that
struck
San
Francisco
, , O
will
in
the
short
term
create
a
two
price
system
for
quake
communities
, , O
with
dwellings
built
on
sturdy
ground
likely
to
demand
higher
prices
. . O

One
San
Francisco
neighborhood
likely
to
test
Mr
Rosen
's
theory
soon
is
the
city
's
fashionable
Marina
district
, , O
which
boasts
some
of
the
highest
home
prices
in
the
state
. . O

The
district
, , O
built
on
landfill
, , O
suffered
heavy
quake
damage
, , O
including
collapsed
buildings
. . O

Yesterday
, , O
the
city
demolished
two
dwellings
in
the
district
because
of
severe
structural
damage
and
said
as
many
as
19
of
the
district
's
350
dwellings
might
have
to
be
razed
. . O

Brokers
agreed
with
the
two
price
theory
. . O

`` `` O
My
gut
feeling
is
that
the
Marina
properties
will
be
affected
, , O
'' '' O
said
Grace
Perkins
, , O
senior
vice
president
at
Grubb
& CC
Ellis
Residential
Brokerage
Inc

Neither
she
nor
other
real
executives
and
brokers
could
project
how
much
less
Marina
properties
might
bring
, , O
but
she
said
the
two
price
structure
would
affect
prices
`` `` O
for
a
while
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Rosen
said
the
quake
will
revive
consumer
interest
in
a
little
1972
state
law
that
requires
brokers
to
disclose
to
potential
buyers
how
close
a
property
sits
to
a
fault
line
. . O

Because
of
the
size
of
the
California
market
, , O
few
relocation
specialists
expect
a
widespread
corporate
flight
in
the
quake
's
aftermath
. . O

But
they
said
the
quake
will
force
some
companies
to
relocate
or
expand
part
or
all
of
their
operations
outside
the
state
. . O

`` `` O

Mr

said
the

prod

to
consider
moving

Because
of
the
quake
threat

`` `` O
some

The
Canadian
government
introduced
in
the
House
of
Commons
legislation
to
extend
federal
regulatory
authority
over
provincial
government
telephone
utilities
in
Alberta

Saskatchewan

The
legislation

telephone
services

more
competition

telephone
business
in

three
provinces
, , O
federal
officials

The

initiative
follows
a

that
the

telephone
companies

provinces

interprovincial
undertakings

had
regulated
only
the

The

telephone
companies

The
extension
of

regulatory
authority
over
telephone
utilities
in
the
Atlantic
provinces
has

required
special
legislation

fueled

Some
analysts
said
the

price
index
reflects
a
more
significant
slowdown
in
the
U
economy
than
earlier
indicated
. . O

They
point
out
that
September
's
producer
index
showed

They
noted
that
because
the
consumer
price
index
, , O
known

is
a
more
comprehensive
measure
of
inflation
and
is
rising
less
rapidly
than
the

index
, , O
or
PPI
, , O
it
could
signal
further
easing
by

Others
suggested

however

that
the
Fed
will
hold
any
changes
in
monetary
policy
in
check

leaving

down
from

level
that
prevailed
from
July

Kevin
Logan
, , O
chief
economist
with

Swiss
Bank
Corp
, , O
said
that
both
PPI
and
CPI
climbed
around
4
1
% NN
year
in

He
argued
that
both
CPI
and
PPI
have
in

decelerated
since
spring

`` `` O
The
Fed
wo

be
stampeded

'' '' O
Mr

predicting
that

are
. . O

A
four
matched
sale
agreement
, , O
a
move
to
drain
liquidity
from
the
system
, , O
was
viewed
as
a
technical
move

rather
than
an
indication
of
tightening
credit

Market
participants
note
that
the

continues

heftier
gains
against

the

it

`` `` I

it
would

but
would

identify

H
Block
is
one
of
the
great
success
stories
of
U
business
. . O

Oddly
enough
, , O
this
presents
a
problem
for
the
stock
. . O

Some
money
managers
are
disenchanted
with
H
Block
because
they
suspect
the
company
's
glory
days
are
past
, , O
or
at
least
passing
. . O

Block
's
tax
business
is
mature
, , O
they
say
, , O
and
some
of
its
diversifications
are
facing
tough
competition
. . O

It
's
no
secret
that
Block
dominates
the
mass
tax
business
. . O

The
Street
knows
all
about
the
predictability
of
its
earnings
, , O
which
are
headed
for
a
ninth
consecutive
yearly
increase
. . O

The
company
has
consistently
earned
more
than
a
20
% NN
annual
return
on
its
net
worth
while
many
companies
would
be
happy
with
15
% NN
. . O

But
the
tax
business
simply
has
no
more
room
to
grow
, , O
says
Mark
Cremonie
, , O
director
of
research
for
Capital
Supervisors
Inc
, , O
a
Chicago
firm
that
manages
$ $ B
6

`` `` O
You

'' '' O

Mr

held
about

That
was

more

`` `` O
One

`` `` O
is
that
Congress

Tax

sold
the

its
H
Block

earlier
this

`` `` O
They

thrashing
around

'' '' O
he
says

`` `` O
I
think
a

are
just

Last
week
the

high

getting
roughed
up
in

minicrash

It
closed
yesterday
at

. . O

To
be
sure
, , O
the
stock
still
has
a
lot
of
fans
. . O

`` `` O
If
you
invested
$ $ B

the
initial

Many

own

Research
counts
five
brokerage
houses
that
consider
the
stock
a
buy
, , O
and
four
that
call
it
a
hold
. . O

None
dare
say
to
sell
it
. . O

But
some
money
managers
are
doing
just
that
. . O

Eugene
Sit
, , O
president
of
Sit
Investment
Associates
in
Minneapolis
, , O
says
, , O
`` `` O
When
we
bought
it
, , O
we
thought
the
growth
rate
was
going
to
accelerate
'' '' O
because
of
computerized
tax
filing
and
instant
refunds
-LRB
the
customer
gets
a
refund
immediately
but
pays
extra
to
the
tax
preparer
, , O
which
waits
for
Uncle
Sam
's
check
-RRB
. . O

But
neither
of
those
developments
did
much
to
juice
up
growth
, , O
Mr
Sit
says
. . O

He
figures
Block
earnings
are
now
growing
at
about
a
10
% NN
annual
rate
-LRB
down
from
about
14
% NN
the
past
five
years
-RRB
and
will
grow
at
an

% NN
rate
in
the
future

That
's
`` `` O
not
bad

'' '' O
Mr

says

but
it
sure
does

justify
Block
shares
being
priced
at
15

16
times
estimated

He
wants

CompuServe

concedes
H

`` `` O

Thomas

used

lost
some
of
their
mystery
in
1973
when
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
set
up
a
special
exchange
to
deal
in

Until

So
the

who
ran
the

listened
when
Joseph
Sullivan
, , O
a
35
former
Wall

offered
them
the
idea

After

the

The

Seabrook
officials
said
the

could
receive
a
full
license
by
the
end

The

rejected
Mr

argument
that

which
owns
the

of
Seabrook
, , O
and

Mr

was
seeking
a
waiver
of
NRC
policy
that
ignores
financial
considerations
in

In

the

Slowing

temporarily
idle

assembly

first

1986

About

and
overtime
has
been
eliminated
at
the
plant
for
the

a
Chrysler
spokesman
said

That
's
a
significant
change
from
earlier
this
year
when
the
plant
worked
substantial
overtime
only
to
have
sales
fall
short

bullish
expectations

Sales
of

the

Jeep
, , O
and
the

Wagoneer
were
actually
up
about
10

through
the
end

But
that
's
less
than
Chrysler
officials
had
hoped
when
they
set
ambitious
production
schedules
for
the
Toledo
plant
earlier
this
year
. . O

Even
when
it
became
clear
this
spring
that
demand
was

coming
up
to
expectations
, , O
Chrysler
officials
`` `` B
resisted
'' '' O
cutting
output
because
Cherokee
and
Wagoneer
are
`` `` O
very
profitable
vehicles

'' '' O
the
spokesman
said

Instead
, , O
Chrysler
officials
in

slapped

cash
rebates
on
the
vehicles
, , O
including
the
first
such
incentives
on
the
popular
four
Cherokee
since
Chrysler
bought
Jeep
in
1987
. . O

The
incentives
boosted
sales
for
a
while
, , O
but
the
pace
had
cooled
by
last
month

The
result
: : O
Chrysler
dealers
had
a
bloated

A

government
agency
conditionally
approved

applied

Board
to
export
9
trillion

of

delta
natural
gas
over

years
starting

. . O

To
be
economically
feasible
, , O
the
11
billion
Canadian
dollar
-LRB
US
9
billion
-RRB
project
requires
almost
a
doubling
of
natural

export
prices
. . O

It
also
faces
numerous
other
hurdles
including
an
agreement
on
a
pipeline
route
for
the
gas
. . O

The
board
said
the
export
licenses
would
be
issued
on
the
condition
that
Canadian
interests

also
be
allowed

bid
for
the

Where
do
Americans
put
their
money
? . O

It
depends
on
when
you
look
. . O

In
1900
, , O
for
instance
, , O
less
than
8
% NN
of
assets
went
into
bank
deposits

That
rose
to
nearly
18
% NN

and
has
n
changed
much
since

reserves

made
up
a
relatively
small
part

assets
until

decade
, , O
when
they
skyrocketed
. . O

And
there
has
been
a
drastic
decline
in
the
importance
of
unincorporated
business
assets

thanks
to
industry
consolidation
and
a
decline
in

Some

But
other
figures

surprising

Housing

for

has
remained

steady

household
assets

although

`` `` O

'' '' O
says
Edward

Wolff

professor

at

`` `` O
But
it

that

The

McCaw
is
seeking

the
revised
offer
includes
a
feature
requiring

veto
rights
to
any
acquisition
if
they
unanimously
decide
it
is

in

Independent
directors

depress
the
private

value

Orange
Workers
are
holding
the
pillars
steady
. . O

The
Orange
Workers
-- : O
who
take
their
name
from
William
of
Orange
of
the
Netherlands
, , O
a
hero
of
the
Dutch
Afrikaners
-- : O
believe
that
the
solution
to
South
Africa
's
racial
problems
is
n
the
abolition
of
apartheid
, , O
it
's
the
perfection
of
apartheid
-- : O
complete
and
total
separation
of
the
races
. . O

Here
, , O
then
, , O
is
where
the
Orange
Workers
have
come
to
make
apartheid
's
last
stand
. . O

Their
idea
is
to
create
a
city
, , O
first
, , O
and
then
an
entire
nation
-- : O
without
blacks
. . O

This
may
seem
to
be
a
preposterous
and
utterly
futile
effort
in
Africa
. . O

And
the
fact
that
there
are
only
3
card
Orange
Workers
may
put
them
on
the
loony
fringe
. . O

But
their
ideal
of
an
Afrikaner
homeland
, , O
an
all
reserve
to
be
carved
out
of
present
South
Africa
, , O
is
a
mainstream
desire
of
the
right
, , O
which
embraces
about
one
of
the
country
's
five
million
whites
. . O

Afrikaner
philosophers
and
theologians
have
long
ruminated
on
the
need
for
a
white
homeland
. . O

The
Orange
Workers
are
just
putting
this
preaching
into
practice
. . O

Thus
, , O
farmer
Johan
Fischer
, , O
his
T
and
jeans
covered
in
grease
, , O
crawls
around
under
his
planter
, , O
tightening
bolts
and
fixing
dents
. . O

On
almost
every
other
farm
in
South
Africa
, , O
black
workers
do
the
repairs
. . O

But
not
here
. . O

Mr
Fischer
plows
his
own
fields
, , O
sows
his
own
corn
and
sunflowers
, , O
and
feeds
his
own
sheep
. . O

Over
at
the
fiberglass
factory
, , O
four
white
workers
assemble
water
tanks
on
their
own
, , O
and
in
their
spare
time
they
build
townhouses
across
the
road
. . O

On
Main
Street
, , O
Alida
Verwoerd
and
her
daughters
look
after
the
clothes
and
fabric
shop
, , O
then
hurry
home
to
fix
lunch
for
the
rest
of
the
family
. . O

Down
by
the
stream
, , O
a
group
of
Orange
Workers
puts
the
finishing
touches
on
a
golf
course
. . O

If
whites
want
to
play
there
by
themselves
, , O
says
consulting
engineer
Willem
van
Heerden
, , O
whites
should
also
build
it
by
themselves
. . O

`` `` O
If
we
want
to
survive
as
a
people
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
, , O
`` `` O
we
have
to
change
our
way
of
life
. . O

The
Afrikaner
must
end
his
reliance
on
others
. . O
'' '' O

In
their
quest
to
perfect
apartheid
, , O
the
Orange
Workers
have
discovered
a
truth
that
most
of
privileged
white
South
Africa
tries
mightily
to
deny
: : O
The
master
ca
n
become
dependent
on
the
slave
and
expect
to
remain
master
forever
. . O

`` `` O
If
apartheid
means
you
want
cheap
black
labor
and
all
the
comforts
that
go
with
it
, , O
but
you
also
want
to
exclude
the
blacks
from
social
and
political
integration
, , O
then
these
are
two
contradictions
that
ca
n
go
on
forever
, , O
'' '' O
says
Mr
Verwoerd
. . O

He
is
sitting
in
his
living
room
, , O
beneath
a
huge
portrait
of
his
late
father
, , O
Hendrik
F
Verwoerd
, , O
apartheid
's
architect
and
South
African
prime
minister
from
1958
to
1966
. . O

Somewhere
, , O
the
son
sighs
, , O
things
went
terribly
wrong
with
apartheid
; : O
today
, , O
whites
even
rely
on
blacks
to
police
their
separation
. . O

`` `` O
People
took
separate
development
as
an
opportunity
to
use
black
labor
without
ever
getting
rid
of
it
. . O

But
my
father
meant
it
to
mean
real
separation
, , O
'' '' O
says
the
son
. . O

The
Orange
Workers
speak
sincerely
. . O

`` `` O
We
agree
with
world
opinion
that
the
status
quo
in
South
Africa
is
morally
wrong
, , O
'' '' O
says
Pieter
Bruwer
, , O
the
Orange
Workers
' POS
chief
scribe
and
pamphleteer
. . O

`` `` O
We
must
either
integrate
honestly
or
segregate
honestly
. . O
'' '' O

Morgenzon
has
long
been
a
special
domain
of
Afrikanerdom
. . O

According
to
Mr
Verwoerd
, , O
the
early
Afrikaner
pioneers
were
the
first
people
to
settle
in
the
eastern
Transvaal
, , O
even
before
the
blacks
. . O

Then
, , O
when
Morgenzon
was
incorporated
in
1908
, , O
the
farmer
who
owned
the
land
stipulated
that
only
whites
could
reside
in
town
; : O
blacks
could
work
there
, , O
but
they
had
to
leave
at
night
. . O

Today
, , O
Morgenzon
is
a
town
of
800
whites
and
two
paved
roads
. . O

Weeds
push
up
through
the
cracks
in
the
sidewalks
, , O
and
many
houses
and
storefronts
are
empty
. . O

There
are
few
factories
and
no
mines
. . O

It
was
an
ideal
place
for
the
Orange
Workers
to
start
their
new
nation
, , O
unencumbered
by
the
demographics
that
have
undermined
apartheid
elsewhere
in
South
Africa
. . O

So
far
, , O
about
150
Orange
Workers
have
moved
here
, , O
spending
nearly
$ $ I
1
million
buying
up
property
over
the
past
three
years
. . O

Still
, , O
complete
and
total
segregation
remains
elusive
. . O

Just
beyond
the
city
limits
is
a
shantytown
of
2
blacks
who
are
employed
throughout
the
area
. . O

Despite
the
Orange
Workers
' POS
intention
to
put
them
all
out
of
work
, , O
they
are
in
no
hurry
to
leave
. . O

A
young
man
called
July
-LRB
that
's
when
he
was
born

, , O
who
works
at
the
railroad
station
just
up
the
street
from
the
Orange
Workers
office

points
at
the
whitewalled
building
and
says
matter
, , O
`` `` O
We
're
not
allowed

there
, , O
that
's
all
I
know
. . O
'' '' O

The
650
local
whites
who
are
n
Orange
Workers
are
more
troubled
. . O

Try
as
they
might
, , O
they
just
ca
n
conceive
of
life
without
black
workers
. . O

`` `` O
Impossible
, , I
impossible
, , O
'' '' O
say
the
Conradies
, , O
an
elderly
couple
who
have
run
the
general
store
for
decades
. . O

`` `` O
We
ca
n
do

their
help

'' '' O
says
Mrs
Conradie
. . O

`` `` O
Oh
no

We
need

and
I
thank
God
for

'' '' O

Over
at
the
Shell
station
, , O
owner
Rudi
van
Dyk
, , O
who
doubles
as
Morgenzon
's
mayor
, , O
worries
that
the
Orange
Workers
have
made
his
town
the
laughingstock
of
the
nation
. . O

`` `` O
What
they
want
us
to
do
just
is

practical

'' '' O
he
says
, , O
noting
that
he
employs
16
blacks

`` `` O
I
could

afford

hire
16

The
only
Afrikaners

this
salary
would

know
how

'' '' O

Back
at
the
Verwoerd
house
, , O
Hendrik
Sr
peers
down
over
the
shoulder
of
Hendrik
Jr
. . O

The
son
believes
that
when
the
Afrikaners
finally
realize
there
is
no
turning
back
the
integration
of
South
African
society
and
politics
, , O
Morgenzon
will
boom

`` `` O
We
urge
our
people
not
to
wait
until
they
have
to
fight
for
their
own
nation
, , O
'' '' O
says
Mr
Verwoerd

`` `` O
By
populating

place
now
, , O
we
make
ourselves
a
power

new
government

have
to
take
into

'' '' O

Curiously
, , O
he
compares
the
Orange
Workers
to
the
ANC
, , O
which
his
father
outlawed
in
1960
. . O

`` `` O
The
ANC

is
a
provision
for

aspirations

'' '' O
says
Mr
Verwoerd
. . O

`` `` O
Likewise
, , O
no
government
will
stop
this
idea
of
the
Afrikaners

'' '' O

He
apologizes
for
sounding
pushy
. . O

`` `` O
Look
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
, , O
`` `` O
If
the
rest
of
South
Africa

And
they
will

Okay

now
you
can
pick
up
that

But
do

do
anything
rash

After

's

plunge

investment
professionals
cautioned
people
to
resist
the
urge
to
call

brokers

Not

the

BankAmerica
Corp
reported
a
34
% NN
jump
in
third
earnings
, , O
as
its
rocket
recovery
from
nearly
ruinous
losses
several
years
ago
continued
to
be
fueled
by
growth
in
consumer
loans
, , O
higher
interest
margins
and
negligible
loan
losses
. . O

For
the
quarter
, , O
BankAmerica
said
it
earned
$ $ B
254
million
, , O
or
$ $ B
1
a
share
, , O
compared
with
$ $ B
190
million
, , O
or
97
cents
a
share
, , O
a
year
earlier
. . O

BankAmerica
spokesmen
said
preliminary
reports
indicate
the
company
was
n
materially
affected
by
the
Tuesday
earthquake
. . O

All
but
eight
of
the
850
branches
, , O
which
had
some
structural
damage
, , O
reopened
yesterday
for
business
. . O

Automated
teller
machine
operations
also
were
up
and
operating
yesterday
, , O
a
bank
spokesman
said
. . O

For
the
first
time
in
nearly
two
years
, , O
BankAmerica
results
failed
to
improve
in
consecutive
quarters
, , O
but
the
decline
from
the
second
quarter
was
attributable
to
special
factors
. . O

Third
profit
was
16
% NN
below
the
$ $ I
304
million
, , I
or
$ $ I
1
a
share
, , O
earned
in
the
1989
second
quarter
. . O

The
company
cited
higher
tax
credits
in
the
second
quarter
, , O
totaling
$ $ B
63
million
, , O
compared
with
$ $ B
28
million
in
the
third
quarter
. . O

Excluding
tax
credits
, , O
profit
was
6
% NN
below
the
second
quarter
. . O

But
that
drop
was
caused
entirely
by
a
decline
in
Brazilian
interest
paid
, , O
to
$ $ B
5
million
from
$ $ B
54
million
the
second
quarter
. . O

Moreover
, , O
BankAmerica
continued
to
build
its
reserve
against
troubled
foreign
loans
by
boosting
its
loan
provision
to
$ $ B
170
million
, , O
about
the
same
as
the
previous
quarter
but
well
above
the
$ $ I
100
million
in
the
year
quarter
. . O

The
provision
rate
was
far
above
BankAmerica
's
actual
net
credit
losses
of
$ $ B
24
million
in
the
third
quarter
, , O
compared
with
$ $ B
18
million
in
the
second
period
and
$ $ B
38
million
a
year
earlier
. . O

As
a
result
, , O
BankAmerica
said
its
reserve
against
troubled
foreign
loans
, , O
once
below
25
% NN
, , O
now
amounts
to
45
% NN
of
the
$ $ I
6
billion
of
non
debt
it
calculates
it
is
owed
by
those
nations
. . O

That
level
is
about
the
same
as
some
other
big
banks
, , O
but
far
below
the
85
% NN
and
100
% NN
reserves
of
Bankers
Trust
New
York
Corp
and
J
Morgan
& CC
Co
, , O
respectively
. . O

By
any
measure
, , O
third
earnings
were
still
robust
, , O
equivalent
to
a
0
% NN
return
on
assets
even
excluding
tax
credits
. . O

By
that
key
measure
of
operating
efficiency
, , O
BankAmerica
turned
in
a
better
performance
than
its
well
Los
Angeles
competitor
, , O
Security
Pacific
Corp
, , O
which
posted
a
0
% NN
return
in
the
third
quarter
. . O

But
it
continued
to
badly
trail
its
San
Francisco
neighbor
, , O
Wells
Fargo
& CC
Co
, , O
which
reported
an
extraordinary
1
% NN
return
on
assets
. . O

Both
returns
do
n
include
any
tax
credits

`` `` O

an

In
composite
trading
yesterday
on
the
New

Stock
Exchange
, , O
BankAmerica
common
stock
edged
up
12
cents
to
close
at
$ $ B
32
a
share
. . O

Shareholder
equity
improved
to
4
% NN
from
4
% NN
in
the
previous

. . O

The
4
% NN
net
interest
margin
, , O
or
the
difference
between
the
yield
on
a
bank
's
investments
and
the

was
still
markedly
higher
than
the
3
% NN
ratio
a
year
earlier
, , O
and
is
among
the
best
in
the
industry
, , O
analysts
said
. . O

The
high
margin
partly
stems
from
continued
strong
growth
in
high
consumer
loans
, , O
which
jumped
31
% NN
to
$ $ B
17

International
Business
Machines
Corp
will
announce
on
Tuesday
a
slew
of
software
products
aimed
at
eliminating
some
of
the
major
problems
involved
in
computerizing
manufacturing
operations
, , O
industry
executives
said
. . O

Many
plant
floors
currently
resemble
a
Tower
of
Babel
, , O
with
computers
, , O
robots
and
machine
tools
that
generally
speak
their
own
language
and
have
trouble
talking
to
each
other
. . O

As
a
result
, , O
if
a
problem
develops
on
a
production
line
, , O
it
is
unlikely
some
supervisor
sitting
in
front
of
a
personal
computer
or
workstation
will
know
about
it
or
be
able
to
correct
it
. . O

So
IBM
will
be
announcing
more
than
50
products
that
will
be
aimed
at
letting
even
the
dumbest
machine
tool
talk
to
the
smartest
mainframe
, , O
or
anything
in
between
. . O

In
an
unusual
display
of
openness
, , O
IBM
also
will
be
helping
customers
tie
together
operations
that
include
lots
of
equipment
made
by
IBM
's
competitors
. . O

In
addition
, , O
the
executives
said
IBM
will
be
offering
programming
tools
designed
to
let
anyone
working
on
a
factory
floor
write
ad
software
, , O
for
instance
, , O
to
do
statistical
analysis
that
would
pinpoint
a
problem
on
a
manufacturing
line
. . O

In
Armonk
, , O
N
, , O
an
IBM
spokeswoman
confirmed
that
IBM
executives
will
be
announcing
some
computer
plans
next
week
but
declined
to
elaborate
. . O

The
industry
executives
said
that
, , O
as
usual
with
such
broad
announcements
from
IBM
, , O
this
one
will
be
part
reality
and
part
strategy
. . O

So
it
will
take
many
quarters
for
IBM
to
roll
out
all
the
products
that
customers
need
, , O
and
it
will
take
years
for
customers
to
integrate
the
products
into
their
operations
. . O

Also
as
usual
, , O
the
products
will
appeal
mostly
to
heavy
users
of
IBM
equipment
, , O
at
least
initially
. . O

Still
, , O
consultants
and
industry
executives
said
the
products
could
help
make
manufacturing
operations
more
efficient
, , O
and
provide
a
boost
to
the
computer
market
-- : O
a
market
that
Yankee
Group
, , O
a
research
firm
, , O
has
said
may
double
to
$ $ B
40
billion
by
1993
. . O

`` `` O
This
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
, , O
'' '' O
said
Martin
Piszczalski
, , O
a
Yankee
Group
analyst
. . O

He
added
, , O
though
, , O
that
`` `` O
a
lot
of
this
is
intentions
... : O
. . O

We
'll
have
to
wait
and
see
'' '' O
how
the
plan
develops
. . O

The
announcements
also
should
help
IBM
go
on
the
offensive
against
Digital
Equipment
Corp
on
the
plant
floor
. . O

While
IBM
has
traditionally
dominated
the
market
for
computers
on
the
business
side
of
manufacturing
operations
and
has
done
well
in
the
market
for
design
tools
, , O
Digital
has
dominated
computerized
manufacturing
. . O

Hewlett
Co
also
has
begun
to
gain
share
in
the
whole
computer
arena
. . O

IBM
will
face
an
uphill
climb
against
Digital
, , O
given
Digital
's
reputation
for
being
better
than
IBM
at
hooking
together
different
manufacturers
' POS
computers
. . O

In
addition
, , O
Hewlett
, , O
while
a
much
smaller
player
, , O
has
made
a
big
commitment
to
the
sorts
of
industry
standards
that
facilitate
those
hookups
and
could
give
IBM
some
problems
. . O

Both
can
be
expected
to
go
after
the
market
aggressively
: : O
Gartner
Group
Inc
, , O
a
research
firm
, , O
estimated
the
Digital
gets
30
% NN
of
its
revenue
from
the
manufacturing
market
, , O
and
Hewlett
gets
50
% NN
. . O

IBM
, , O
which
Gartner
Group
said
generates
22
% NN
of
its
revenue
in
this
market
, , O
should
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
its
loyal
following
among
buyers
of
equipment
. . O

That
is
because
many
companies
will
standardize
on
certain
types
of
equipment
as
the
various
parts
of
the
manufacturing
market
merge
, , O
and
IBM
is
the
biggest
player
. . O

But
much
will
depend
on
how
quickly
IBM
can
move
. . O

The
whole
idea
of
computer
manufacturing
, , O
CIM
, , O
seems
to
be
making
a
comeback
after
losing
a
little
luster
over
the
past
couple
of
years
when
it
became
apparent
that
it
was
n
a
panacea
that
would
make
U
plants
more
efficient
and
banish
foreign
competition
. . O

Erik
Keller
, , O
a
Gartner
Group
analyst
, , O
said
organizational
changes
may
still
be
required
to
really
take
advantage
of
CIM
's
capabilities
-- : O
someone
on
the
shop
floor
may
not
like
having
someone
in
an
office
using
a
personal
computer
to
look
over
his
shoulder
, , O
for
instance
, , O
and
may
be
able
to
prevent
that
from
happening
. . O

But
he
said
a
system
such
as
IBM
's
should
help
significantly
. . O

In
making
polyethylene
sheets
out
of
plastic
chips
, , O
for
instance
, , O
a
chip
sometimes
does
n
melt
, , O
gets
caught
in
the
machinery
and
creates
a
run
in
the
sheets
. . O

That
can
be
expensive
, , O
because
the
problem
may
not
be
noticed
for
a
while
, , O
and
the
sheets
are
typically
thrown
away
. . O

But
Mr
Keller
said
that
, , O
if
computers
can
be
integrated
into
the
process
, , O
they
could
alert
an
operator
as
soon
as
the
problem
occurred
. . O

They
could
also
check
through
the
orders
on
file
to
find
a
customer
that
was
willing
to
accept
a
lower
grade
of
polyethylene
. . O

The
computer
would
let
the
machine
run
just
until
that
order
was
filled
, , O
eliminating
waste
. . O

This
sort
of
improved
link
figures
to
eventually
become
a
significant
weapon
for
some
companies
. . O

Companies
might
be
able
to
tell
salespeople
daily
, , O
for
instance
, , O
about
idle
equipment
, , O
so
they
could
offer
discounts
on
whatever
that
equipment
produces
. . O

Salespeople
also
could
get
a
precise
reading
on
when
products
could
be
delivered
-- : O
in
much
the
same
way
that
Federal
Express
has
marketed
its
ability
to
tell
exactly
where
a
package
is
in
the
delivery
system
. . O

Ford
Motor
Co
's
Merkur
, , O
the
company
's
first
new
car
franchise
in
the
U
since
the
Edsel
was
unveiled
in
1957
, , O
now
will
share
Edsel
's
fate
. . O

Ford
said
yesterday
it
will
halt
imports
of
the
Merkur
Scorpio
, , O
a
$ $ I
28
luxury
sedan
built
by
Ford
of
Europe
in
West
Germany
. . O

The
cars
are
sold
under
a
separate
franchise
with
its
own
sign
in
front
of
Lincoln
dealers
-- : O
as
opposed
to
new
models
such
as
Taurus
or
Escort
, , O
which
are
sold
under
existing
Ford
divisions
. . O

The
move
to
halt
imports
-- : O
announced
29
years
and
11
months
to
the
day
after
Henry
Ford
II
declared
that
the
Edsel
division
and
its
gawky
car
would
be
scrapped
-- : O
kills
the
four
Merkur
brand
in
the
U
market
. . O

It
will
continue
to
be
sold
in
the
European
market
. . O

Merkur
's
death
is
n
nearly
as
costly
to
Ford
as
was
the
Edsel
debacle
, , O
because
Merkur
was
a
relatively
low
project
with
limited
sales
goals
. . O

Still
, , O
Merkur
's
demise
is
a
setback
for
Ford
at
a
time
when
the
company
's
image
as
the
U
auto
maker
with
the
golden
touch
is
showing
signs
of
strain
. . O

The
No
2
auto
maker
's
new
Thunderbird
and
Mercury
Cougar
models
have
n
met
sales
expectations
in
the
year
since
they
were
introduced
, , O
and
Ford
's
trucks
are
losing
ground
to
their
GM
rivals
. . O

This
fall
, , O
Ford
introduced
only
one
new
product
: : O
A
restyled
version
of
its
hulking
Lincoln
Town
Car
luxury
model
. . O

The
demise
of
Merkur
-LRB
pronounced
mare
-RRB
comes
after
a
September
in
which
670
Merkur
dealers
managed
to
sell
only
93
Scorpios
. . O

Total
Merkur
sales
for
the
first
nine
months
dropped
46
% NN
from
a
year
ago
to
just
6
cars
. . O

Merkur
is
n
the
only
European
luxury
brand
having
problems
in
the
U
. . O

The
Japanese
assault
on
the
luxury
market
is
rapidly
overshadowing
such
European
makes
as
Audi
and
Saab
, , O
which
at
least
have
clear
brand
images
. . O

Merkur
, , O
as
an
import
on
domestic
car
lots
, , O
suffered
from
the
same
sort
of
image
confusion
that
is
hobbling
sales
of
imports
at
General
Motors
Corp
and
Chrysler
Corp
. . O

Merkur
was
originally
aimed
at
enticing
into
Lincoln
dealerships
the
kind
of
young
, , I
affluent
buyers
who
would
n
be
caught
dead
in
a
Town
Car
-- : O
a
vehicle
so
bargelike
that
Ford
is
staging
a
press
event
next
month
linking
the
Town
Car
's
launch
to
the
commissioning
of
a
new
aircraft
carrier
in
Norfolk
, , O
Va
. . O

But
the
brand
had
trouble
from
the
start
. . O

The
first
Merkur
, , O
the
XR4Ti
, , O
went
on
sale
in
early
1985
. . O

The
sporty
coupe
foundered
in
part
because
American
buyers
did
n
go
for
the
car
's
unusual
double
rear
spoiler
. . O

In
May
1987
, , O
Ford
began
importing
the
Scorpio
sedan
from
West
Germany
to
sell
next
to
a
redesigned
XR4Ti
in
showrooms
. . O

Ford
officials
said
they
expected
the
two
Merkurs
would
sell
about
15
cars
a
year
, , O
and
in
1988
they
reached
that
goal
, , O
as
sales
hit
15
cars
. . O

It
was
downhill
from
there
, , O
however
. . O

One
major
factor
was
the
decline
of
the
dollar
against
the
mark
, , O
which
began
less
than
a
year
after
Merkur
's
1985
launch
. . O

As
the
West
German
currency
rose
, , O
so
did
Merkur
prices
. . O

The
Merkur
cars
also
suffered
from
spotty
quality
, , O
some
dealers
say
. . O

`` `` O
It
was
like
a
comedy
of
errors
, , O
'' '' O
says
Martin
J
`` `` I
Hoot
'' '' I
McInerney
, , O
a
big

this
bill
because
we
thought
it
would
help
Skinner
, , O
'' '' O
one
Republican
said
, , O
`` `` O
and
now
we
're
out
there
dangling
in
the
wind

'' '' O

A
few
weeks
ago
, , O
Mr
Skinner
testified
before
Congress
that
it
would
be
`` `` O
cleaner
, , O
more
efficient
'' '' O
if
he
had
authority
to
block
buy
in
advance
. . O

But
he
never
took
an
official
position
on
the
bill
and
has
steadfastly
maintained
that
he
already
has
enough
authority
to
deal
with
buy
. . O

Under
the
committee
bill
, , O
the
Transportation
secretary
would
have
30
days
, , O
and
an
additional
20
days
if
needed
, , O
to
review
any
proposed
purchase
of
15
% NN
or
more
of
a
major
U
airline
's
voting
stock
. . O

The
secretary
would
be
required
to
block
an
acquisition
if
he
concluded
that
it
would
so
weaken
an
airline
financially
that
it
would
hurt
safety
or
reduce
the
carrier
's
ability
to
compete
, , O
or
if
it
gave
control
to
a
foreign
interest
. . O

Although
the
legislation
would
apply
to
any
acquisition
of
a
major
airline
, , O
it
is
aimed
at
transactions
financed
by
large
amounts
of
debt
. . O

Supporters
of
the
bill
are
concerned
an
airline
might
sacrifice
costly
safety
measures
in
order
to
repay
debt
. . O

The
panel
's
action
occurs
in
a
politically
charged
atmosphere
surrounding
recent
buy
proposals
, , O
their
apparent
collapse
and
the
volatile
conditions
in
the
stock
market
. . O

`` `` O
It
became
apparent
in
hearings
that
there
ought
to
be
regulation
of
leveraged
buy
of
some
sort
, , O
'' '' O
Rep
James
Oberstar
-LRB
D
, , O
Minn
-RRB
, , O
chairman
of
the
House
Aviation
Subcommittee
, , O
said
during
the
panel
's
deliberations
. . O

`` `` O
I
do
n
believe
in
the
airline
business
you
can
be
totally
laissez
because
of
the
high
degree
of
public
interest
'' '' O
at
stake
. . O

But
Mr
Skinner
disagreed
, , O
calling
the
legislation
`` `` O
a
retreat
from
the
policy
of
deregulaton
of
the
airline
industry
. . O
'' '' O

In
his
letter
to
Committee
Chairman
Glenn
Anderson
-LRB
D
, , O
Calif
-RRB
, , O
the
secretary
also
said
the
bill
`` `` O
would
be
at
odds
with
the
administration
's
policies
welcoming
open
foreign
investment
and
market
allocation
of
resources
. . O
'' '' O

Currently
, , O
the
Transportation
Department
does
n
have
the
authority
to
block
a
takeover
in
advance
. . O

However
, , O
if
the
secretary
concludes
that
a
transaction
has
made
a
carrier
unfit
to
operate
, , O
the
department
may
revoke
its
certificate
, , O
grounding
the
airline
. . O

Such
authority
is
more
than
adequate
, , O
say
opponents
of
the
legislation
. . O

But
supporters
argue
that
grounding
an
airline
is
so
drastic
that
the
department
would
hesitate
doing
it
. . O

The
panel
rejected
a
proposal
pushed
by
AMR
Corp
, , O
the
parent
of
American
Airlines
, , O
to
allow
the
Transportation
secretary
to
block
corporate
raiders
from
waging
proxy
fights
to
oust
boards
that
oppose
a
leveraged
buy
. . O

It
also
voted
down
proposals
to
give
the
secretary
much
more
discretion
on
whether
to
block
a
buy
and
to
require
the
department
to
consider
the
impact
of
a
buy
on
workers

as

To
make
them
directly
comparable
, , O
each
index
is
based
on
the
close
of
1969
equaling
100
. . O

The
percentage
change
is
since
year
. . O

Housing
construction
sank
in
September
to
its
lowest
level
since
the
last
recession
, , O
the
Commerce
Department
reported
. . O

Work
began
on
homes
and
apartments
at
an
annual
rate
of
1
units
last
month
, , O
down
5
% NN
from
August
, , O
the
department
said
. . O

The
September
decline
followed
an
even
steeper
drop
of
6
% NN
in
August
and
left
housing
starts
at
their
weakest
since
October
1982
, , O
when
the
country
was
nearing
the
end
of
a
recession
. . O

Originally
the
department
had
reported
the
August
decline
as
5
% NN
. . O

The
numbers
suggest
that
the
housing
industry
is
still
suffering
the
effects
of
the
Federal
Reserve
's
battle
against
inflation
. . O

The
industry
had
shown
signs
of
recovery
this
summer
, , O
after
the
central
bank
began
to
relax
its
clamp
on
credit
, , O
allowing
interest
rates
to
drop
a
bit
after
pushing
them
up
for
a
year
. . O

Sales
of
new
homes
rose
and
inventories
of
houses
, , O
which
had
been
climbing
, , O
dropped
. . O

But
last
month
new
construction
in
all
types
of
homes
waned
, , O
from
single
houses
to
large
apartment
complexes
. . O

`` `` O
It
's
pretty
much
weak
across
the
board
, , O
'' '' O
said
Martin
Regalia
, , O
chief
economist
of
the
National
Council
of
Savings
Institutions
. . O

Mr
Regalia
said
the
industry
may
be
reluctant
to
step
up
building
at
the
moment
for
fear
the
inventories
of
unsold
homes
will
increase
again
. . O

Another
reason
for
the
weakness
, , O
he
said
, , O
may
be
that
mortgage
rates
have
hit
a
plateau
since
they
began
edging
down
after
a
peak
in
March
. . O

In
August
, , O
rates
on
30
fixed
mortgages
started
creeping
up
a
bit
, , O
but
they
inched
down
again
through
September
. . O

`` `` O
Rates
have
n
really
peeled
off
that
much
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Regalia
said
. . O

`` `` O
We
've
kind
of
settled
now
into
an
interest
environment
that
's

high

a

That
followed

in

The

Sebastian
Guzman
Cabrera
took
over
the
oil
workers
union
, , O
Mexico
's
most
powerful
labor
organization
, , O
only
last
January
. . O

But
even
in
that
short
time
Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
has
become
as
controversial
in
his
own
way
as
his
deposed
predecessor
, , O
Joaquin
Hernandez
Galicia
, , O
known
as
La
Quina
. . O

President
Carlos
Salinas
de
Gortari
used
the
army
to
oust
La
Quina
, , O
who
reigned
for
28
years
over
a
graft
empire
that
made
state
Petroleos
Mexicanos
, , I
or
Pemex
, , O
one
of
the
world
's
most
inefficient
oil
companies
. . O

Now
, , O
Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
is
facing
accusations
that
he
's
as
much
a
company
man
as
La
Quina
was
a
crook
. . O

In
recent
contract
negotiations
with
Pemex
management
, , O
Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
accepted
major
concessions
that
greatly
curtail
the
union
's
role
in
subcontracting
, , O
long
a
source
of
millions
of
dollars
in
illicit
earnings
. . O

And
with
the
quiet
pragmatism
of
Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
replacing
the
prickly
populism
of
La
Quina
, , O
government
technocrats
have
been
given
a
free
hand
to
open
the
petrochemical
sector
to
wider
private
and
foreign
investment
. . O

Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
's
new
order
has
n
arrived
without
resistance
. . O

Brawls
between
union
factions
still
erupt
at
Pemex
installations
. . O

Leftist
leader
Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas
publicly
questioned
Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
's
`` `` I
moral
quality
, , O
'' '' O
suggesting
he
is
part
of
a
conspiracy
to
turn
over
the
country
's
oil
, , O
a
symbol
of
Mexican
nationalism
, , O
to
foreigners
. . O

The
61
Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
takes
such
criticisms
in
stride
. . O

`` `` O
This
is
n
a
new
kind
of
union
leadership
, , O
it
's
a
new
Mexico
. . O

We
're
no
longer
afraid
of
associating
with
private
or
foreign
capital
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
. . O

Pemex
, , O
which
produces
40
% NN
of
government
revenue
, , O
desperately
needs
new
investment
. . O

Since
world
oil
prices
collapsed
in
1982
, , O
the
government
has
siphoned
Pemex
's
coffers
to
make
payments
on
Mexico
's
$ $ B
97
billion
foreign
debt
. . O

Little
money
has
been
returned
to
upgrade
Pemex
's
aging
facilities
. . O

While
the
government
drains
Pemex
from
above
, , O
the
union
has
drained
it
from
below
. . O

A
bloated
payroll
and
pervasive
graft
caused
Pemex
's
operating
costs
to
balloon
to
95
cents
of
each
$ $ I
1
in
sales
, , O
far
above
the
industry
norm
. . O

The
declines
in
investment
and
efficiency
explain
in
part
why
Mexico
has
been
importing
gasoline
this
year
. . O

Some
projections
show
Mexico
importing
crude
by
the
end
of
the
century
, , O
barring
an
overhaul
of
operations
. . O

`` `` O
Whatever
you
tried
to
change
, , O
whether
it
was
cutting
costs
or
attracting
new
partners
, , O
the
big
obstacle
was
the
old
union
leadership
, , O
'' '' O
says
oil
consultant
George
Baker
. . O

Enter
Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
, , O
who
has
a
clear
understanding
of
where
union
leaders
fit
in
the
pro
regime
of
President
Salinas
. . O

`` `` O
I
'm
the
secretary
, , O
if
there
is
one
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
, , O
greeting
a
visitor
to
his
office
. . O

Beginning
as
a
laborer
in
a
refinery
, , O
Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
put
in
more
than
40
years
at
Pemex
before
being
pushed
into
retirement
by
La
Quina
after
a
dispute
two
years
ago
. . O

Though
he
also
long
benefited
from
the
system
built
by
La
Quina
, , O
Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
says
union
perks
had
simply
gotten
out
of
hand
. . O

They
are
`` `` O
at
the
base
of
all
of
the
problems
of
corruption
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
. . O

Thus
, , O
in
recent
contract
negotiations
, , O
Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
gave
up
the
union
's
right
to
assign
40
% NN
of
all
of
Pemex
's
outside
contracts
-- : O
an
enormous
source
of
kickbacks
. . O

The
union
also
ceded
the
2
% NN
commission
it
had
received
on
all
Pemex
maintenance
contracts
. . O

-LRB
The
union
will
keep
a
2
% NN
commission
on
construction
projects
. . O
-RRB

The
new
contract
also
eliminates
the
$ $ I
15
monthly
coupon
, , O
good
only
at
union
grocery
stores
, , O
that
was
part
of
the
salary
of
every
worker
, , O
from
roughneck
to
chief
executive
. . O

About
9
technical
workers
, , O
notably
chemists
and
lawyers
, , O
were
switched
to
non
status
. . O

Also
, , O
because
of
its
reduced
capital
budget
, , O
Pemex
has
phased
out
about
50
transitory
construction
workers
, , O
reducing
the
work
force
to
about
140
, , O
the
union
leader
says
. . O

Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
says
the
union
's
sacrifices
will
be
offset
by
a
wage
and
benefit
package
that
amounts
to
a
22
% NN
increase
in
compensation
. . O

But
Pemex
managers
are
the
ones
most
thrilled
by
the
contract
. . O

`` `` O
We
are
retaking
the
instruments
of
administration
, , O
'' '' O
says
Raul
Robles
, , O
a
Pemex
subdirector
. . O

Pemex
officials
would
n
say
how
much
money
the
new
contract
would
save
the
company
, , O
but
one
previous
government
estimate
pegged
savings
at
around
$ $ I
500
million
a
year
. . O

Pemex
's
customers
also
are
pleased
with
the
company
's
new
spirit
. . O

Grupo
Desc
, , O
a
big
conglomerate
, , O
has
long
depended
on
Pemex
petrochemicals
to
produce
plastic
packing
material
. . O

But
when
the
Pemex
plant
shut
down
for
an
annual
overhaul
, , O
it
would
never
give
notice
to
its
customers
. . O

`` `` O
The
capriciousness
would
completely
disrupt
our
operations
, , O
'' '' O
says
Ernesto
Vega
Velasco
, , O
Desc
's
finance
director
. . O

This
year
, , O
for
the
first
time
, , O
Desc
and
other
customers
were
consulted
well
in
advance
of
the
Pemex
plant
's
shutdown
to
ensure
minimal
inconvenience
. . O

Taming
the
union
complements
previous
moves
by
the
government
to
attract
private
investment
in
petrochemicals
, , O
which
Mexico
has
been
forced
to
import
in
large
quantities
in
recent
years
. . O

In
May
, , O
the
government
unveiled
new
foreign
investment
regulations
that
create
special
trusts
allowing
foreigners
, , O
long
limited
to
a
40
% NN
stake
in
secondary
petrochemical
companies
, , O
to
own
up
to
100
% NN
. . O

Later
, , O
the
government
reclassified
several
basic
petrochemicals
as
secondary
products
. . O

But
Pemex
's
courtship
with
private
companies
, , O
and
especially
foreign
ones
, , O
is
controversial
in
a
country
where
oil
has
been
a
symbol
of
national
sovereignty
since
foreign
oil
holdings
were
nationalized
in
1938
. . O

`` `` O
They
are
preparing
the
workers
for
what

coming

foreign
control
, , O
'' '' O
wrote
Heberto
Castillo
, , O
a
leftist
leader
. . O

Mr
Guzman
Cabrera
and
government
officials
insist
that
foreigners
will
be
limited
to
investing
in
secondary
petroleum
products
. . O

But
the
new
union
leader
makes
no
apologies
for
Pemex
's
more
outward
attitude
. . O

`` `` O
If
we
do
not
integrate
into
this
new
world
of
interdependence
, , O
sooner
or
later
we
're
going
to
become
victims

Power

participated

Mr
Stevens
's
remarks
, , O
confirming
a
report
in
The
Wall
Street
Journal
that
British
Air
wants
to
start
from
scratch
in
any
new
bid
for
the
nation
's
second
airline
, , O
helped
push
UAL
stock
lower
for
the
fourth
straight
day

UAL
fell
$ $ B
6
a
share
to
$ $ B
191
on
volume
of
2
million
shares
in
composite
trading
on
the
New

Stock
Exchange
as
concern
deepened
among
takeover
stock
traders
about
the
length
of
time
it
will
take
to
revive
the
purchase
. . O

Under
the
original
buy
approved
by
the
UAL
board
Sept
14
, , O
UAL
's
pilots
planned
to
put
up
$ $ B
200
million
in
cash
and
make
$ $ B
200
million
in
annual
cost
concessions
for
a
75
% NN
stake
. . O

UAL
management
was
to
pay
$ $ B
15
million
for
10
% NN
, , O
and
British
Air
was
to
receive
a
15
% NN
stake
. . O

The
buy
fell
through
when
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp
unexpectedly
failed
to
obtain
bank
financing
. . O

Since
then
, , O
UAL
stock
has
fallen
33
% NN
in
what
may
rank
as
the
largest
collapse
of
a
takeover
stock
ever
. . O

The
tenor
of
Mr
Stevens
's
remarks
seemed
to
indicate
that
British
Air
will
take
a
more
active
, , I
high
role
in
pursuing
any
new
bid
. . O

He
said
he
believes
UAL
management
was
badly
advised
on
the
funding
of
its
original
transaction

Mr
Stevens
said
British
Air
has
n
received
any
new
buy
proposals
from
the
labor
group

led
by
UAL
Chairman
Stephen
Wolf

received
any

might

`` `` O
As

as
we
're
concerned

we
're
waiting

dust

he
said
. . O

Although
British
Air
is
waiting
to
see
what
the
buy
group
comes
up
with
, , O
Mr
Stevens
said
a
revised
transaction
with
less
debt
leverage
is
likely
to
be
more
attractive
to
banks
. . O

He
said
the
original
proposal
is
dead
, , O
and
all
aspects
of
a
revised
version
are
up
for
change
, , O
in
light
of
the
changes
in
UAL
's
market
price
, , O
the
amount
of
debt
banks
are
willing
to
fund
, , O
and
the
price
British
Air
would
be
willing
to
pay
. . O

Mr
Stevens
said
he
expects
the
new
price
will
be
considerably
lower
, , O
but
declined
to
specify
a
figure
. . O

Asked
whether
a
$ $ I
230
figure
circulating
in
the
market
yesterday
is
too
low
, , O
he
said
, , O
`` `` O
It
's
certainly
not
too
low
. . O
'' '' O

He
added
the
original
offer
was
`` `` O
a
pretty
full
price
, , O
'' '' O
and
that
British
Air
's
contribution
`` `` O
was
quite
a
large
chunk
for
us
. . O
'' '' O

British
Air
was
originally
attracted
to
the
chance
of
obtaining
a
15
% NN
stake
in
the
company
, , O
but
was
n
particularly
happy
with
paying
$ $ B
750
million
. . O

`` `` O
If
the
-LCB
new
-RCB
deal
had
us
putting
up
less
money
but
still
having
15
% NN
, , O
that
would
be
a
point
in
our
favor
, , O
'' '' O
he
said
. . O

In
any
new
proposal
, , O
British
Air
would
expect
a
greater
rate
of
return
than
the
20
in
the
original
proposal
. . O

In
the
event
that
the
buy
group
stalls
in
reviving
its
bid
, , O
the
UAL
board
could
remain
under
some
pressure
to
seek
another
transaction
, , O
even
without
any
legal
obligation
to
do
so
. . O

Roughly
one
of
its
stock
is
believed
held
by
takeover
stock
traders
, , O
who
could
vote
to
oust
the
board
if
they
become
impatient
. . O

Meanwhile
, , O
the
buy
group
's
task
of
holding
its
fragile
coalition
together
, , O
in
the
face
of
the
bid
's
collapse
and
internal
opposition
from
two
other
employee
groups
, , O
has
been
further
complicated
by
an
apparent
rift
in
the
ranks
of
the
pilot
union
itself
. . O

A
pilot
representing
a
group
of
220
pilots
hired
during
United
's
1985
strike
filed
suit
Friday
in
Chicago
federal
court
to
block
the
takeover
. . O

The
dissident
pilots
oppose
the
plan
because
it
would
cause
them
to
lose
their
seniority
. . O

UAL
's
management
agreed
to
reduce
the
seniority
of
those
pilots
in
exchange
for
the
support
of
the
United
pilot
union
for
the
buy
proposal
. . O

The
220
pilots
involved
in
the
suit
are
n
members
of
the
union
. . O

The
airline
had
allowed
them
to
move
ahead
of
some
union
members
in
seniority
following
the
1985
strike
, , O
a
move
the
union
had
contested
in
a
previous
lawsuit

these

offset

higher
administrative
costs

according
to
the
report
by
a
panel
of
health
experts

The
report
suggested
that
current
review
programs
are
too
narrow

`` `` O
The
unnecessary
and
inappropriate
use
of
the

the
actual

the

`` `` O

'' '' O

The
report
said
that
utilization
management
should
have
more
of
an
impact

Howard

a

said
that

also
do
a
better
job

containing

it
spreads
to
cover
medical
services
delivered
outside
of

`` `` O
There
's
pretty
good
evidence
that

said

mushroomed

`` `` O
It

Dr
Bailit
said

David
Rahill
of
A
Foster
Higgins

said
that
clients
of
his
consulting
firm
report
that
utilization
management
reduces
their
hospital
care
bills
by
about
5
% NN
, , O
but
he
agreed
that
for
the
health
system
as
whole
, , O
some
of
these
savings
are
offset
by
administrative
and
outpatient
care
costs

Jerome
Grossman

agrees
that
administrative
costs

be
high

Dr

`` `` O

the

Renault
and
DAF
Trucks
NV
announced
a
preliminary
agreement
to
jointly
manufacture
a
line
of
trucks
in
Britain
and
France

Philippe
Gras
, , O
a
Renault
managing
director

said
the
new
line
will
cover
trucks

between
2
tons

4

and
will
be
built
at
Renault
's
Bapilly
plant
in
France

at
DAF
's
British
plant

The
French
state
auto
group

truck
maker
plan

their
product
lines

they
begin
production

Mr
Gras
said
he
expects
a
definitive
agreement
between
the
two
companies
to
be
completed
in
the
next
few
months

The
venture
is
the
latest
example

the
trend
toward
cooperative
projects
in
Europe
ahead
of
the
1992
deadline
for
eliminating
trade
barriers
within
the
European
Community

Renault
and
DAF
are
expected
to
invest
a
total
of
about
three

French
francs

$ $ B
157
million

the
venture

In

the

will
each
spend
about

up
their
plants

Mr
Gras
said
the
joint
venture
represents
considerable
savings
for
both
Renault

DAF
, , O
since
both
companies
would
in
any
case
have
had
to
renew
their
existing
ranges

By
pooling
their
resources

the
two
groups
have
effectively
halved
the
design

development
costs
that
would
otherwise
have
been
entailed

he
said

Renault
officials
said
the
potential
European
market
for
light
trucks
in
the
2

4
range
is
between
700

800
vehicles
annually

and
Renault
and
DAF
are
aiming
for
a
combined
market
share
of
about
11

Both
Renault
and
DAF
will
have
world
marketing
rights

the
new

light

Under
a
separate
arrangement
, , O
British
Aerospace

also
be
able

offer
the
vehicles

its
dealers

the
U

and
Renault
's
truck
subsidiary
Renault
Vehicles
Industriels
will
have
similar
rights

DAF

British
Aerospace

with
a
further
6

held
by
the
Dutch
state
chemical
group
NV
DSM
. . O

The
van
Doorne
family
of
the
Netherlands
holds
an
additional
11

of
DAF
's
capital
. . O

The
Federal
Reserve
System
is
the
standard
object
of
suggestions
for
organizational
and
institutional
changes
, , O
for
two
reasons
. . O

First
, , O
its
position
in
the
government
is
anomalous
. . O

It
has
an
unusual
kind
of
independence
from
elected
officials
and
still
has
authority
over
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
government
's
instruments
-- : O
the
control
of
the
money
supply
. . O

Thus
we
have
a
condition
that
is
easily
described
as
undemocratic
. . O

Second
, , O
the
responsibilities
of
the
Federal
Reserve
as
guardian
of
the
currency
, , O
which
means
as
guardian
of
the
stability
of
the
price
level
, , O
sometimes
lead
it
to
take
measures
that
are
unpopular
. . O

As
former
Fed
Chairman
William
McChesney
Martin
used
to
say
, , O
they
would
have
to
take
the
punch
bowl
away
just
as
the
party
is
getting
interesting
. . O

So
the
Federal
Reserve
is
an
attractive
target
for
complaint
by
politicians
. . O

The
Fed
is
easily
assigned
the
blame
for
unpleasantness
, , O
like
high
interest
rates
or
slow
economic
growth
, , O
while
the
politicians
can
escape
responsibility
by
pointing
to
the
Fed
's
independence
. . O

This
leads
to
proposals
for
`` `` O
reform
'' '' O
of
the
Fed
, , O
which
have
the
common
feature
of
making
the
Fed
more
responsive
to
the
administration
, , O
to
the
Congress
and
to
public
opinion
-- : O
without
, , O
however
, , O
any
assumption
of
additional
responsibility
by
the
politicians
. . O

These
proposals
include
changing
the
term
of
the
chairman
, , O
shortening
the
terms
of
the
members
, , O
eliminating
the
presidents
of
the
Federal
Reserve
Banks
from
the
decision
process
, , O
putting
the
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
on
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
, , O
having
the
Fed
audited
by
an
arm
of
Congress
-LRB
the
General
Accounting
Office
-RRB
, , O
putting
the
Fed
's
expenditures
in
the
budget
, , O
and
requiring
prompt
publication
of
the
Fed
's
minutes
. . O

Some
of
these
ideas
are
again
under
consideration
in
Congress
. . O

But
these
proposals
do
not
rest
on
a
view
of
what
the
Fed
's
problem
is
or
, , O
if
they
do
, , O
they
rest
on
an
incorrect
view
. . O

They
would
not
solve
the
problem
; : O
they
would
make
it
worse
. . O

The
problem
is
not
that
the
Fed
is
too
unresponsive
to
the
public
interest
. . O

On
the
contrary
, , O
it
is
too
responsive
to
an
incorrect
view
of
the
public
interest
. . O

The
price
level
in
the
U
is
now
about
4
1
times
as
high
as
it
was
30
years
ago
. . O

On
average
, , O
something
that
cost
$ $ B
100
30
years
ago
now
costs
$ $ B
425
. . O

Or
, , O
a
wage
that
was
$ $ B
100
30
years
ago
would
buy
only
$ $ I
23
worth
of
stuff
today
. . O

On
two
occasions
the
inflation
rate
rose
to
more
than
10
% NN
a
year
. . O

In
each
case
the
ending
of
this
unsustainable
inflation
caused
a
severe
recession
-- : O
the
two
worst
of
the
postwar
period
. . O

The
enormous
inflation
over
the
past
30
years
was
largely
due
to
monetary
policy
. . O

At
least
, , O
it
would
not
have
happened
without
the
support
of
monetary
policy
that
provided
for
a
10
increase
in
the
money
supply
during
the
same
period
. . O

And
that
increase
in
the
money
supply
would
not
have
happened
without
the
consent
of
the
Federal
Reserve
. . O

The
basic
problem
of
monetary
policy
, , O
to
which
reform
of
the
Fed
should
be
addressed
, , O
is
to
prevent
a
recurrence
of
this
experience
. . O

There
were
two
general
reasons
for
the
mistaken
monetary
policy
of
the
past
30
years
: : O

1
. . O
To
some
extent
the
Federal
Reserve
shared
the
popular
but
incorrect
view
that
expansionary
monetary
policy
could
yield
a
net
improvement
in
employment
and
output
. . O

2
. . O
Even
where
the
Fed
did
not
share
this
view
it
felt
the
need
to
accommodate
to
it
. . O

Despite
all
the
formal
provisions
for
its
independence
, , O
the
Fed
seems
constantly
to
feel
that
if
it
uses
its
independence
too
freely
it
will
lose
it
. . O

The
common
proposals
for
reforming
the
Fed
would
only
make
the
situation
worse
, , O
if
they
had
any
effect
at
all
. . O

Putting
the
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
on
the
Board
of
Governors
, , O
one
of
the
leading
proposals
today
, , O
is
an
example
. . O

The
secretary
is
the
world
's
biggest
borrower
of
money
. . O

He
has
a
built
, , I
constant
longing
for
lower
interest
rates
. . O

Moreover
, , O
he
is
a
political
agent
of
a
political
president
, , O
who
naturally
gives
extraordinary
weight
to
the
way
the
economy
will
perform
before
the
next
election
, , O
and
less
to
its
longer
health
. . O

These
days
, , O
the
secretary
suffers
the
further
disqualification
that
he
is
a
member
of
a
club
of
seven
finance
ministers
who
meet
occasionally
to
decide
what
exchange
rates
should
be
, , O
which
is
a
diversion
from
the
real
business
of
the
Federal
Reserve
to
stabilize
the
price
level
. . O

How
should
a
reasonable
member
of
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
interpret
a
congressional
decision
to
put
the
secretary
on
the
board
? . O

Could
he
plausibly
interpret
it
as
encouragement
for
the
Fed
to
give
primary
emphasis
to
stabilizing
the
price
level
? . O

Or
would
he
interpret
it
as
instruction
to
give
more
weight
to
these
other
objectives
that
the
secretary
represents
-- : O
low
interest
rates
, , O
short
economic
expansion
, , O
and
stabilization
of
exchange
rates
at
internationally
managed
levels
? . O

The
answer
seems
perfectly
clear
. . O

-LRB
True
, , O
a
succession
of
Fed
chairmen
has
given
color
to
the
notion
that
the
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
belongs
on
the
Fed
. . O

By
their
constant
readiness
to
advise
all
and
sundry
about
federal
budgetary
matters
the
chairmen
have
encouraged
the
belief
that
fiscal
policy
and
monetary
policy
are
ingredients
of
a
common
stew
, , O
in
which
case
it
is
natural
that
the
Fed
and
the
Treasury
, , B
and
probably
also
the
Congress
, , O
should
be
jointly
engaged
in
stirring
the
pot
. . O

The
Fed
's
case
for
its
own
independence
would
be
a
little
stronger
if
it
were
more
solicitous
of
the
independence
of
the
rest
of
the
government
. . O
-RRB

The
Fed
's
problem
is
not
that
it
is
too
independent
, , O
or
too
unpolitical
. . O

The
Fed
is
responsive
to
, , O
and
can
not
help
being
responsive
to
, , O
the
more
overtly
political
part
of
the
government
. . O

The
Fed
exercises
a
power
given
to
it
by
Congress
and
the
president
. . O

But
Congress
and
the
president
accept
no
responsibility
for
the
exercise
of
the
power
they
have
given
the
Fed
. . O

Critics
of
the
present
arrangement
are
correct
to
say
that
it
is
undemocratic
. . O

What
is
undemocratic
is
the
unwillingness
of
the
more
political
parts
of
the
government
to
take
the
responsibility
for
deciding
the
basic
question
of
monetary
policy
, , O
which
is
what
priority
should
be
given
to
stabilizing
the
price
level
. . O

To
leave
this
decision
to
an
`` `` I
independent
'' '' I
agency
is
not
only
undemocratic
. . O

It
also
prevents
the
conduct
of
a
policy
that
has
a
long
rationale
, , O
because
it
leaves
the
Fed
guessing
about
what
are
the
expectations
of
its
masters
, , O
the
politicians
, , O
who
have
never
had
to
consider
the
long
consequences
of
monetary
policy
. . O

The
greatest
contribution
Congress
could
make
at
this
time
would
be
to
declare
that
stabilizing
the
price
level
is
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
Federal
Reserve
System
. . O

Legislation
to
this
effect
has
been
introduced
in
Congress
in
this
session
by
Rep
Stephen
Neal
-LRB
D
, , O
N
. . O
-RRB
. . O

It
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
likely
to
be
enacted
, , O
however
. . O

Congress
would
be
required
to
make
a
hard
decision
, , O
and
Congress
would
much
prefer
to
leave
the
hard
decision
to
the
Fed
and
retain
its
rights
of
complaint
after
the
fact
. . O

People
will
say
that
the
nation
and
the
government
have
other
objectives
, , O
in
addition
to
stabilizing
the
price
level
, , O
which
is
true
. . O

But
that
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
the
Federal
Reserve
has
other
objectives
. . O

The
government
has
other
agencies
and
instruments
for
pursuing
these
other
objectives
. . O

But
it
has
only
the
Fed
to
pursue
price
stability
. . O

And
the
Fed
has
at
most
very
limited
ability
to
contribute
to
the
achievement
of
other
objectives
by
means
other
than
by
stabilizing
the
price
level
. . O

The
two
objectives
most
commonly
thought
to
be
legitimate
competitors
for
the
attention
of
the
Fed
are
high
employment
and
rapid
real
growth
. . O

But
the
main
lesson
of
economic
policy
in
the
past
30
years
is
that
if
the
Fed
compromises
with
the
price
objective
in
the
pursuit
of
these
other
goals
, , O
the
result
is
not
high
employment
and
rapid
growth
but
is
inflation

have
abortions
will
probably
pass
both
houses
of
the
Michigan
legislature
and
set
up
a
grinding
battle
to
override
the
expected
veto
of
Democratic
Gov
James
Blanchard
. . O

The
short
shift
in
the
political
climate
surrounding
abortion
reflects
two
factors
that
are
likely
to
govern
the
debate
in
the
next
several
months
: : O
the
reawakening
of
the
abortion
movement
as
a
potent
force
after
years
of
lassitude
, , O
and
the
ability
of
each
side
to
counter
the
other
's
advance
in
one
arena
with
a
victory
of
its
own
elsewhere
. . O

The
action
in
Pennsylvania
, , O
for
example
, , O
will
follow
last
week
's
collapse
of
a
special
session
of
the
Florida
legislature
to
enact
restrictions
on
abortions
in
that
state
, , O
and
the
vote
here
in
Washington
by
the
House
to
permit
federally
paid
abortions
for
poor
women
who
are
victims
of
rape
or
incest
. . O

But
President
Bush
is
expected
to
veto
the
congressional
legislation
and
that
, , O
along
with
the
easy
approval
of
the
Pennsylvania
measure
, , O
is
likely
to
mute
the
abortion
activists
' POS
claims
of
momentum
and
underline
the
challenges
faced
by
this
resurgent
movement
. . O

`` `` O
It
's
great
to
feel
good
for
once
in
15
years
, , O
'' '' O
says
Harrison
Hickman
, , O
a
consultant
to
abortion
advocates
, , O
reflecting
the
relief
of
his
compatriots
after
last
week
's
victories
, , O
the
first
major
events
since
the
Supreme
Court
, , O
in
its
July
3
Webster
decision
, , O
permitted
the
states
to
enact
restrictions
on
abortions
. . O

`` `` O
But
how
many
more
times
we
're
going
to
feel
good
in
the
next
15
is
another
question
. . O
'' '' O

Indeed
, , O
abortion
activists
still
face
their
greatest
tests
. . O

`` `` O
The
pro
movement
has
shown
-- : O
finally
-- : O
that
it
can
mobilize
, , O
'' '' O
says
Glen
Halva
, , O
a
Furman
University
political
scientist
who
specializes
in
how
state
legislators
handle
the
abortion
question
. . O

`` `` O
But
it
still
has
n
shown
that
it
can
win
in
a
state
like
Pennsylvania
or
Missouri
, , O
where
abortion
has
been
clearly
an
electoral
issue
and
where
it
's
been
an
emotional
issue
for
a
long
time
. . O
'' '' O

The
foes
of
abortion
hold
the
strong
whip
hand
in
Pennsylvania
, , O
where
abortion
activists
are
so
much
on
the
defensive
that
their
strategy
is
less
to
fight
the
proposed
legislation
than
it
is
to
stress
how
the
state
legislature
does
n
reflect
the
viewpoints
of
the
state
's
citizens
. . O

As
a
result
, , O
GOP
state
Rep
Stephen
Freind
of
Delaware
County
, , O
the
legislature
's
leading
foe
of
abortion
, , O
has
been
given
all
but
free
rein
to
press
a
strict
seven
plan
to
restrict
abortion
and
, , O
he
hopes
, , O
to
force
the
Supreme
Court
directly
to
reassess
its
1973
Roe
v
Wade
decision
that
established
the
right
of
abortion
in
the
first
place
. . O

The
Freind
legislation
-- : O
the
state
's
House
Judiciary
Committee
approved
it
in
Harrisburg
this
week
and
the
full
Pennsylvania
House
is
expected
to
take
up
the
bill
next
Tuesday
-- : O
includes
a
provision
to
ban
abortions
after
24
weeks
of
pregnancy
, , O
except
to
avert
the
death
of
the
mother
. . O

Mr
Freind
calculates
that
the
provision
, , O
which
attacks
the
trimester
standards
that
Roe
established
, , O
will
`` `` O
make
it
necessary
'' '' O
for
the
Supreme
Court
to
review
Roe
and
, , O
perhaps
, , I
to
overturn
it
. . O

But
the
Pennsylvania
measure
also
includes
an
`` `` I
informed
consent
'' '' I
provision
that
may
become
widely
imitated
by
abortion
foes
who
want
to
make
women
contemplating
abortion
as
uncomfortable
as
possible
with
the
procedure
and
with
themselves
. . O

Under
this
legislation
, , O
a
woman
must
be
informed
24
hours
before
the
operation
of
the
details
of
the
procedure
and
its
risks
. . O

`` `` O
Regardless
of
whether
one
supports
or
opposes
the
right
to
an
abortion
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Freind
argues
, , O
`` `` O
it
is
virtually
impossible
for
any
rational
human
being
to
disagree
with
the
concept
that
a
woman
has
the
right
to
have
all
of
the
appropriate
materials
and
advice
made
available
to
her
before
she
makes
a
decision
which
, , O
one
way
or
the
other
, , O
might
remain
with
her
for
the
rest
of
her
life
. . O
'' '' O

In
Michigan
, , O
where
the
state
Senate
is
expected
to
approve
parental
legislation
by
the
end
of
next
week
, , O
Gov
Blanchard
is
the
principal
obstacle
for
anti
. . O

Susan
Rogin
, , O
a
consultant
to
abortion
activists
in
the
state
, , O
takes
comfort
from
the
fact
that
the
state
's
House
abortion
opponents
`` `` O
have
n
been
able
to
muster
the
votes
to
overturn
a
veto
on
abortion
in
16
years
. . O
'' '' O

But
proponents
believe
they
may
be
able
to
shake
enough
votes
loose
to
override
the
veto
if
they
are
successful
in
portraying
the
legislation
as
a
matter
of
parents
' POS
rights
. . O

In
Illinois
, , O
lawmakers
will
vote
before
next
spring
on
legislation
requiring
physicians
to
perform
tests
on
fetuses
at
20
weeks
to
determine
their
gestational
age
, , I
weight
and
lung
maturity
along
with
a
provision
requiring
that
, , O
if
fetuses
survive
an
abortion
, , O
a
second
doctor
must
be
on
hand
to
help
it
survive
. . O

The
legislation
failed
by
one
vote
to
clear
the
House
Rules
Committee
Tuesday
, , O
but
anti
still
may
succeed
in
bringing
the
measure
to
the
floor
this
fall
. . O

Pamela
Sutherland
, , O
executive
director
of
the
Illinois
Planned
Parenthood
Council
, , O
says
she
and
her
allies
are
`` `` B
cautiously
optimistic
'' '' O
they
can
defeat
it
if
it
comes
to
a
floor
vote
. . O

Abortion
foes
in
Wisconsin
, , O
meanwhile
, , O
expect
a
parental
bill
to
be
sent
to
the
state
assembly
floor
by
early
November
and
are
hopeful
of
prevailing
in
both
houses
by
next
March
. . O

In
Texas
, , O
abortion
opponents
want
to
pass
parental
legislation
along
with
a
statewide
ban
on
the
use
of
public
funds
, , I
personnel
and
facilities
for
abortion
, , O
and
viability
tests
for
fetuses
19
weeks
and
older

The
anti
are
urging
GOP
Gov
Bill
Clements
to
press
the
issues
in
a
special
session
scheduled
to
run
Nov
14
to
Dec

`` `` O

`` `` O
I
think
the
restructuring
will
get
the
required
support

'' '' O
said
Michael
Pacitti
, , O
an
analyst
at
London
stockbroker
UBS
Phillips

Drew
. . O

`` `` O
The
shareholders
effectively
will
support
the
share
price
by
clearing
the
share
buy
. . O
'' '' O

But
B
's
restructuring
, , O
which
was
never
going
to
happen
quickly
, , O
now
will
take
longer
because
of
the
market
upheaval
. . O

Company
officials
, , I
holders
and
analysts
who
previously
expected
the
disposals
to
be
substantially
complete
by
the
end
of
next
year
's
first
half
now
say
the
market
gyrations
could
delay
the
actions
well
into
the
second
half
. . O

`` `` O
We
are
n
forced
sellers
. . O

We
do
n
have
an
absolute
deadline
and
if
market
conditions
are
truly
awful
we
might
decide
it
is
not
the
right
time
, , O
'' '' O
to
take
particular
steps
, , O
said
Michael
Prideaux
, , O
a
B
spokesman
. . O

Even
if
B
receives
approval
for
the
restructuring
, , O
the
company
will
remain
in
play
, , O
say
shareholders
and
analysts
, , O
though
the
situation
may
unfold
over
the
next
12
months
, , O
rather
than
six
. . O

The
new
B
will
be
a
smaller
tobacco
and
financial
hybrid
whose
price
ratio
may
more
closely
reflect
the
lower
tobacco
business
than
the
higher
financial
business
, , O
these
holders
believe
. . O

Thus
B
's
restructuring
may
only
make
the
company
a
more
manageable
target
for
other
corporate
predators
-- : O
possibly
such
acquisitive
bidders
as
Hanson
PLC
. . O

`` `` O
The
last
few
days
will
surely
slow
down
the
pace
of
events
, , O
'' '' O
says
Scottish
Amicable
's
Mr
Gilchrist
. . O

`` `` O
But
I
would
n
write
off
'' '' O
Sir
James
or
other
potential
bidders
. . O

Among
possible
delays
, , O
the
sales
of
Saks
and
Marshall
Field
-- : O
which
were
expected
to
be
on
the
block
soon
after
the
crucial
Christmas
season
-- : O
may
slide
into
the
second
quarter
or
second
half
. . O

Analysts
estimate
that
sales
of
the
two
businesses
could
raise
roughly
$ $ I
2
billion
. . O

B
is
n
predicting
a
postponement
because
the
units
`` `` O
are
quality
businesses
and
we
are
encouraged
by
the
breadth
of
inquiries
, , O
'' '' O
said
Mr
Prideaux
. . O

But
the
delay
could
happen
if
B
does
n
get
adequate
bids
, , O
he
said
. . O

People
familiar
with
B
say
possible
acquirers
for
the
units
include
managers
from
both
retailing
chains
, , O
and
General
Cinema
Corp
, , O
which
is
interested
in
bidding
for
Saks
. . O

Other
potential
bidders
for
parts
of
B
's
U
retail
unit
include
Dillard
Department
Stores
Inc
, , O
May
Department
Stores
Co
and
Limited
Inc
. . O

B
has
declined
to
identify
the
potential
bidders
. . O

Though
Sir
James
has
said
he
intends
to
mount
a
new
bid
for
B
once
approval
from
U
insurance
regulators
is
received
, , O
jitters
over
prospects
for
junk
financing
and
U
leverage
buy
are
making
investors
more
skeptical
about
Sir
James
's
prospects
. . O

His
initial
offer
indicated
he
needed
to
raise
as
much
as
80
% NN
of
the
takeover
financing
through
the
debt
markets
. . O

Market
uncertainty
also
clouds
the
outlook
for
B
's
attracting
a
premium
price
for
its
U
retailing
properties
. . O

Finally
, , O
Tuesday
's
California
earthquake
initially
knocked
3
% NN
off
B
's
share
price
in
London
yesterday
because
of
fears
of
the
potential
claims
to
Los
Angeles
Farmers
, , O
which
has
a
substantial
portion
of
its
property
and
casualty
exposure
in
California
. . O

On
Farmers
, , O
Mr
Prideaux
said
it
is
too
early
to
quantify
the
level
of
potential
claims
. . O

He
added
B
`` `` O
has
no
expectation
of
a
material
impact

Bridge

highway
collapses

disrupt
truck

transportation

San
Francisco
Bay
area

come

But
rail
, , I
air
and
ocean
links

the

escaped
Tuesday

earthquake
with
only
minor
damage
, , O
and
many

expected
to
be
operating
normally
today
, , O
government
and
corporate
transport
officials
said

Air
traffic
at
San
Francisco
International

was
running

50
% NN
of

yesterday
afternoon
, , O
but
airport
officals
said
they
expect
a
return

The

`` `` O

for
example

In

power
failures

Although

delays

significant
yesterday

they

appear

The
earthquake
shattered

A
United

said
14

Whitbread
's
spirits
auction
occurs
amid
a
parallel
shakeup
in
the
British
beer
industry
. . O

Earlier
this
year
, , O
the
government
announced
plans
to
foster
increased
competition
in
the
industry
. . O

British
brewers
currently
own
thousands
of
pubs
, , O
which
in
turn
sell
only
the
breweries
' POS
beer
and
soft
drinks
. . O

Under
new
rules
, , O
many
of
the
country
's
pubs
would
become
`` `` O
free
houses
, , O
'' '' O
selling
beers
of
their
choice
. . O

Whitbread
now
intends
to
bolster
its
brewing
interests
, , O
in
an
effort
to
grab
a
share
of
sales
to
free
houses
. . O

The
company
, , O
which
last
month
paid
# # B
50
million
for
regional
British
brewer
Boddington
Group
PLC
, , O
has
about
13
% NN
of
the
British
beer
market
. . O

Whitbread
also
owns
the
license
to
brew
and
distribute
Heineken
and
Stella
Artois
beers
in
Britain
. . O

In
addition
, , O
Whitbread
intends
to
focus
on
its
newer
hotel
, , I
liquor
store
and
restaurant
businesses
in
Europe
and
North
America
. . O

In
Britain
, , O
those
interests
include
the
Beefeater
steakhouse
chain
and
joint
ownership
with
PepsiCo
Inc
of
the
country
's
Pizza
Hut
chain
. . O

In
Canada
and
the
U
, , O
Whitbread
owns
The
Keg
chain
of
steak
and
seafood
restaurants
. . O

Focusing
on
beer
, , I
restaurants
and
hotels
means
`` `` O
we
can
concentrate
our
skills
and
resources
more
effectively
, , O
'' '' O
Peter
Jarvis
, , O
Whitbread
's
managing
director
, , O
said
in
a
statement

The
spirits
business
`` `` O
would
require
substantial
additional
investment
to
enable
it
to
compete
effectively
in
the
first
division
of
global
players

Digital
Equipment
Corp
is
planning
a
big
coming
party
on
Tuesday
for
its
first
line
of
mainframe
computers
. . O

But
an
uninvited
guest
is
expected
to
try
to
crash
the
party

On
the
morning
of
the
long
announcement
, , O
International
Business
Machines
Corp
is
to
introduce
its
own
new
mainframe
. . O

`` `` O
Their
attitude
is
, , O
` `` O
You
want
to
talk
mainframes
, , O
we
'll
talk
mainframes

'' '' O
says
one
computer
industry
executive

`` `` O
They

deliberately
trying

steal
our
thunder

'' '' O
a
Digital
executive
complains
. . O

`` `` O
Maybe
we
should
take
it
as
a
compliment
. . O
'' '' O

Digital
's
target
is
the
$ $ I
40
billion
market
for
mainframe
computers
, , O
the
closet
number
that
nearly
every
big
company
needs
to
run
its
business
. . O

IBM
, , O
based
in
Armonk
, , O
N
, , O
has
dominated
the
market
for
decades
. . O

That
does
n
scare
Digital
, , O
which
has
grown
to
be
the
world
's
second
computer
maker
by
poaching
customers
of
IBM
's
mid
machines
. . O

Digital
, , O
based
in
Maynard
, , O
Mass
, , O
hopes
to
stage
a
repeat
performance
in
mainframes
, , O
and
it
has
spent
almost
$ $ I
1
billion
developing
the
new
technology
. . O

A
spoiler
, , O
nimble
Tandem
Computers
Inc
in
Cupertino
, , O
Calif
, , O
jumped
into
the
fray
earlier
this
week
with
an
aggressively
priced
entry
. . O

IBM
appears
more
worried
about
Digital
, , O
which
has
a
broad
base
of
customers
waiting
for
the
new
line
, , O
dubbed
the
VAX
9000

`` `` O
It
's
going
to
be
nuclear
war
, , O
'' '' O
says
Thomas
Willmott
, , O
a
consultant
with
Aberdeen
Group
Inc
. . O

The
surge
in
competition
is
expected
to
stir
new
life
into
the
huge
mainframe
market
, , O
where
growth
has
slowed
to
single
digits
in
recent
years
. . O

IBM
's
traditional
mainframe
rivals
, , O
including
Unisys
Corp
, , O
Control
Data
Corp
and
NCR
Corp
, , O
have
struggled
recently
. . O

Digital
is
promising
a
new
approach
. . O

Robert
M
Glorioso
, , O
Digital
's
vice
president
for
high
performance
systems
, , O
says
Digital
's
mainframe
is
designed
not
as
a
central
computer
around
which
everything
revolves
, , B
but
as
part
of
a
decentralized
network
weaving
together
hundreds
of
workstations
, , O
personal
computers
, , O
printers
and
other
devices
. . O

And
unlike
IBM
's
water
mainframes
, , O
it
does
n
need
any
plumbing
. . O

The
challengers
will
have
a
big
price
advantage
. . O

Digital
is
expected
to
tag
its
new
line
from
about
$ $ I
1
million
to
$ $ B
4
million
and
up
, , O
depending
on
configuration
. . O

That
's
about
half
the
price
of
comparably
equipped
IBM
mainframes
. . O

Tandem
's
pricing
is
just
as
aggressive
. . O

The
heightened
competition
will
hit
IBM
at
a
difficult
time
. . O

The
computer
giant
's
current
mainframe
line
, , O
which
has
sold
well
and
has
huge
profit
margins
, , O
is
starting
to
show
its
age
. . O

The
new
3090s
due
next
week
will
boost
performance
by
only
about
8
% NN
to
10
% NN
. . O

And
IBM
is
n
expected
to
deliver
a
new
generation
of
mainframes
until
1991
. . O

Still
, , O
no
one
expects
IBM
's
rivals
to
deliver
a
knockout
. . O

IBM
has
a
near
on
mainframes
, , O
with
an
estimated
70
% NN
share
of
the
market
. . O

IBM
is
five
times
the
size
of
Digital
-- : O
and
40
times
the
size
of
Tandem
-- : O
and
wields
enormous
market
power
. . O

It
counts
among
its
customers
a
majority
of
the
world
's
largest
corporations
, , O
which
entrust
their
most
critical
business
information
to
IBM
computers
. . O

`` `` O
We
're
not
going
to
walk
in
and
replace
a
company
's
corporate
accounting
system
if
it
's
already
running
on
an
IBM
mainframe
, , O
'' '' O
concedes
Kenneth
H
Olsen
, , O
Digital
's
president
. . O

He
says
Digital
will
target
faster
market
segments
such
as
on
transaction
processing
, , O
which
includes
retail
tracking
, , O
airline
reservations
and
bank
networks
. . O

Tandem
, , O
which
already
specializes
in
on
transaction
processing
, , O
is
a
potent
competitor
in
that
market
. . O

A
key
marketing
target
for
Digital
will
be
the
large
number
of
big
customers
who
already
own
both
Digital
and
IBM
systems
. . O

One
such
company
is
Bankers
Trust
Co
. . O

Stanley
Rose
, , O
a
vice
president
, , O
technological
and
strategic
planning
at
Bankers
Trust
, , O
says
that
despite
Digital
's
low
prices
, , O
`` `` O
we
are
n
about
to
unplug
our
IBM
mainframes
for
a
DEC
machine
. . O

The
software
conversion
costs
would
dwarf
any
savings
. . O
'' '' O

But
Mr
Rose
is
still
looking
seriously
at
the
9000
. . O

Bankers
Trust
uses
Digital
's
VAX
to
run
its
huge
money
and
capital
markets
accounts
, , O
juggling
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
each
day
, , O
he
says
. . O

As
that
system
grows
, , O
larger
computers
may
be
needed
. . O

`` `` O
In
the
past
, , O
customers
had
to
go
to
IBM
when
they
outgrew
the
VAX
. . O

Now
they
do
n
have
to
, , O
'' '' O
he
says
. . O

`` `` O
That
's
going
to
cost
IBM
revenue
. . O
'' '' O

Analysts
say
Digital
can
expect
this
pent
demand
for
the
new
VAX
to
fuel
strong
sales
next
year
. . O

Barry
F
Willman
, , O
an
analyst
at
Sanford
C
Bernstein
& CC
Co
, , O
estimates
the
9000
could
boost
sales
by
more
than
$ $ I
1
billion
in
the
fiscal
year
beginning
in
July
. . O

He
bases
the
estimate
on
a
survey
of
hundreds
of
Digital
's
largest
customers
. . O

Although
Digital
will
announce
a
full
family
of
mainframes
next
week
, , O
it
is
n
expected
to
begin
shipping
in
volume
until
next
year
. . O

The
first
model
available
will
be
the
210
, , O
which
is
likely
to
appeal
to
many
technical
and
scientific
buyers
interested
in
the
optional
super
, , I
or
vector
processor
, , O
says
Terry
Shannon
of
International
Data
Corp
, , O
a
market
research
concern
. . O

Four
more
models
, , O
aimed
squarely
at
IBM
's
commercial
customers
, , O
are
expected
to
begin
shipping
in
late
June
. . O

Most
analysts
do
n
expect
the
new
mainframes
to
begin
contributing
significantly
to
revenue
before
the
fiscal
first
quarter
, , O
which
begins
next
July
1
. . O

Digital
's
new
line
has
been
a
long
time
coming
. . O

The
company
has
long
struggled
to
deliver
a
strong
mainframe
product
, , O
and
made
a
costly
decision
in
1988
to
halt
development
of
an
interim
product
meant
to
stem
the
revenue
losses
at
the
high
end
. . O

Digital
's
failure
to
deliver
a
true
mainframe
machine
before
now
may
have
cost
the
company
as
much
as
$ $ I
1
billion
in
revenue
in
fiscal
1989
, , O
Mr
Willman
says
. . O

IBM
will
face
still
more
competition
in
coming
months
. . O

Amdahl
Corp

backed

Japan

Fujitsu

has
a
growing
share

This

simply
says
that

on

barrier
island
you
have
to
do
so
without

support

Private

annual
decline
in

poverty
rate
, , O
the
Census
Bureau
said
the
1988
drop
was

statistically
significant

The
bureau

report
also
showed
that

some
measures

Mr

structure

rising
number

threshold

defined
as

expenses

calculated
by
the
Agricultural
Department

last
year
was
$ $ B

for
a
family
of

The
Census
Bureau
counts
all
cash
income
in
determining
whether
families
are
below
the
line
, , O
but
it
does
n
consider
other
government
benefits
, , O
such
as
Medicare

Thanks
largely
to
the
continued
growth
of
the
U
economy

the
poverty
rate
is
now
substantially
lower

the
1983

the

Jupiter

so
enormous

Investigating
Jupiter
in

of

: : O
Jupiter

rich
in
elements

these
planets
are
lifeless
; : O
Earth
, , O
on
the
other
hand

has
a
diminished
store
of
such
material

is
rich
in
life

Some
scientists
have
suggested
that
comets

have
brought
enough

Io

Europa
that
showed
them
to
be

the
most
intriguing

The
photos
showed
active
geysers
on
Io
spewing
sulfurous
material
190

indicated
that
Europa
may
have
an
ocean
hidden
under

The
sense
grows
that
modern
public
bureaucracies
simply
do
n
perform
their
assigned
functions
well
. . O

Bally
Manufacturing
Corp
and
New
York
developer
Donald
Trump
have
agreed
in
principle
to
a
$ $ I
6
million
settlement
of
shareholder
litigation
stemming
from
Bally
's
alleged
greenmail
payment
to
Mr
Trump
. . O

According
to
lawyers
familiar
with
the
settlement
talks
, , O
the
verbal
agreement
to
end
a
lawsuit
filed
more
than
two
years
ago
was
reached
last
week
and
will
soon
be
submitted
to
a
federal
judge
in
Camden
, , O
N
. . O

In
February
1987
, , O
Bally
thwarted
a
possible
hostile
takeover
bid
from
Mr
Trump
by
agreeing
to
buy
2
million
of
Mr
Trump
's
3
million
Bally
shares
for
$ $ B
83
million
-- : O
more
than
$ $ I
18
million
above
market
price
. . O

The
term
greenmail
refers
to
a
situation
where
a
company
pays
a
premium
over
market
value
to
repurchase
a
stake
held
by
a
potential
acquirer
. . O

Lawyers
for
shareholders
, , O
Bally
and
Mr
Trump
all
declined
to
talk
publicly
about
the
proposed
settlement
, , O
citing
a
request
by
a
federal
court
magistrate
not
to
reveal
details
of
the
agreement
until
it
is
completed
. . O

But
some
attorneys
who
are
familiar
with
the
matter
said
the
$ $ I
6
million
payment
will
be
shared
by
Bally
and
Mr
Trump
, , O
with
the
casino
and
hotel
concern
probably
paying
the
bulk
of
the
money
. . O

The
amount
Bally
and
Mr
Trump
will
pay
to
settle
the
class
suit
pales
in
comparison
to
the
$ $ I
45
million
Walt
Disney
Co
and
Saul
Steinberg
's
Reliance
Group
Holdings
Inc
agreed
to
pay
to
settle
a
similar
suit
in
July
. . O

That
settlement
represented
the
first
time
shareholders
were
granted
a
major
payment
in
a
greenmail
case
. . O

Mr
Steinberg
made
a
$ $ I
59
million
profit
on
the
sale
to
Disney
of
his
investment
in
the
company
in
1984
. . O

But
lawyers
said
Mr
Steinberg
probably
faced
much
more
potential
liability
because
, , O
when
he
sued
Disney
during
his
takeover
battle
, , O
he
filed
on
behalf
of
all
shareholders
. . O

When
Disney
offered
to
pay
Mr
Steinberg
a
premium
for
his
shares
, , O
the
New
York
investor
did
n
demand
the
company
also
pay
a
premium
to
other
shareholders
. . O

When
Mr
Trump
sued
Bally
, , O
he
sued
only
on
behalf
of
himself
. . O

Mr
Trump
and
Bally
also
appeared
to
have
some
leverage
in
the
case
because
in
the
state
of
Delaware
, , O
where
Bally
is
incorporated
, , O
courts
have
held
that
greenmail
is
often
protected
by
the
business
rule
. . O

That
rule
gives
boards
of
directors
wide
latitude
in
deciding
how
to
deal
with
dissident
shareholders

SENATE
HEARS
final
arguments
in
impeachment
trial
of
federal
judge
. . O

Yesterday
, , O
U
Judge
Alcee
Hastings
faced
his
jury
-- : O
the
full
U
Senate
-- : O
and
said
, , O
`` `` O
I
am
not
guilty
of
having
committed
any
crime

'' '' O

Seventeen
articles
of
impeachment
against
the
Florida
judge
, , O
one
of
the
few
blacks
on
the
U
bench
, , O
were
approved
by
the
House
in
August
1988
. . O

The
central
charge
against
Judge
Hastings
is
that
he
conspired
with
a
Washington
lawyer
to
obtain
a
$ $ I
150
bribe
from
defendants
in
a
criminal
case
before
the
judge
, , O
in
return
for
leniency
. . O

He
is
also
accused
of
lying
under
oath
and
of
leaking
information
obtained
from
a
wiretap
he
supervised
. . O

The
Senate
's
public
gallery
was
packed
with
Judge
Hastings
' POS
supporters
, , O
who
erupted
into
applause
after
he
finished
his
argument
. . O

Judge
Hastings
, , O
who
was
acquitted
of
similar
charges
by
a
federal
jury
in
1983
, , O
claims
he
is
being
victimized
and
that
the
impeachment
proceedings
against
him
constitute
double
jeopardy
. . O

But
Rep
John
Bryant
-LRB
D
, , O
Texas
-RRB
, , O
the
lead
counsel
for
the
House
managers
who
conducted
a
lengthy
inquiry
into
Judge
Hastings
' POS
activities
, , O
said
`` `` O
a
mountain
of
evidence
points
to
his
certain
guilt
. . O
'' '' O

The
Senate
will
deliberate
behind
closed
doors
today
and
is
scheduled
to
vote
on
the
impeachment
tomorrow
. . O

If
the
judge
is
impeached
, , O
as
is
thought
likely
, , O
he
will
be
removed
from
office
immediately
. . O

However
, , O
Judge
Hastings
has
said
he
will
continue
to
fight
and
is
contemplating
an
appeal
of
any
impeachment
to
the
U
Supreme
Court

COMPANIES
SEEKING
to
make
insurers
pay
for
pollution
cleanup
win
court
victory
. . O

In
a
case
involving
Avondale
Industries
Inc
and
its
insurer
, , O
Travelers
Cos
, , O
the
Second
U
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
in
New
York
ruled
in
favor
of
the
company
on
two
issues
that
lawyers
say
are
central
to
dozens
of
pollution
cases
around
the
country
. . O

Travelers
and
other
insurers
have
maintained
that
cleanup
costs
are
n
damages
and
thus
are
n
covered
under
commercial
policies
. . O

They
also
have
argued
that
government
proceedings
notifying
a
company
of
potential
responsibility
do
n
fit
the
legal
definition
of
a
lawsuit
; : O
thus
, , O
such
governmental
proceedings
are
n
covered
by
the
policies
, , O
the
insurers
say
. . O

The
appeals
court
disagreed
on
both
counts
. . O

Avondale
was
notified
by
Louisiana
officials
in
1986
that
it
was
potentially
responsible
for
a
cleanup
at
an
oil
plant
. . O

Avondale
asked
Travelers
to
defend
it
in
the
state
proceeding
, , O
but
the
insurer
did
n
respond
. . O

The
appeals
court
upheld
a
district
judge
's
ruling
that
the
insurer
had
to
defend
the
company
in
such
proceedings
. . O

The
appeals
court
also
said
, , O
`` `` O
We
think
an
ordinary
businessman
reading
this
policy
would
have
believed
himself
covered
for
the
demands
and
potential
damage
claims
'' '' O
stemming
from
any
cleanup
. . O

`` `` O
This
decision
will
have
a
very
considerable
impact

'' '' O
said
Kenneth
Abraham
, , O
professor
of
environmental
law
and
insurance
law
at
the
University
of
Virginia
, , O
because
many
commercial
insurance
policies
are
issued
by
companies
based
in
New

. . O

William
Greaney
, , O
an
attorney
for
the
Chemical
Manufacturers
Association
, , O
said
that
while
other
appeals
courts
have
ruled
differently
on
whether
cleanup
costs
are
damages
, , O
the
influence
of
the
appeals
court
in
New
York
`` `` O
will
make
insurers
sit
up
and
listen
. . O
'' '' O

He
said
the
decision
was
the
first
in
which
a
federal
appeals
court
has
ruled
whether
administrative
government
proceedings
qualify
as
litigation
. . O

Barry
R
Ostrager
, , O
an
attorney
for
Travelers

said

`` `` O
there
are
procedural
bases

NEW

nearly
three

legal
problems

That
is
the
conclusion

by
the
New

Association

The

based
on

a

survey
of

legal
programs

on

with

field

`` `` O
The
report
provides
detailed
documentation
of
the
extent
and
nature

indicates

According

slightly
more

Nearly

Mr

Sperry
Corp

After
failing
to
find
a
buyer
for
the
Sears
Tower
in
Chicago
, , O
Sears
, , I
Roebuck
& CC
Co
is
negotiating
with
Boston
pension
fund
adviser
Aldrich
, , I
Eastman
& CC
Waltch
Inc
to
refinance
the
property
for
close
to
$ $ I
850
million
, , O
according
to
people
close
to
the
negotiations
. . O

Under
the
proposed
agreement
involving
the
world
's
tallest
building
, , O
Chicago
Sears
would
receive
about
half
the
money
through
conventional
mortgage
financing
and
the
other
half
as
a
convertible
mortgage
. . O

At
the
end
of
the
term
of
the
convertible
loan
, , O
Sears
could
still
own
half
the
building
, , O
and
AEW
could
own
the
other
half
. . O

Neither
side
would
comment
. . O

The
parties
are
currently
negotiating
over
who
would
manage
the
building
, , O
which
will
be
emptied
of
6
employees
from
Sears
' POS
merchandise
group
, , O
which
is
moving
elsewhere
. . O

The
new
manager
will
face
the
daunting
task
of
leasing
1
million
square
feet
in
a
relatively
soft
Chicago
real
estate
market
. . O

Also
, , O
it
has
not
yet
been
decided
exactly
how
much
of
the
mortgage
AEW
will
be
able
to
convert
into
equity
. . O

Convertible
mortgages
have
become
an
increasingly
popular
way
to
finance
prestigious
buildings
of
late
. . O

In
a
convertible
mortgage
, , O
the
investor
lends
the
building
owner
a
certain
amount
in
return
for
the
option
to
convert
its
interest
into
equity
, , O
usually
less
than
50
% NN
, , O
at
the
end
of
the
loan
term
. . O

During
the
term
, , O
the
lender
can
either
receive
a
percentage
of
cash
flow
, , O
a
percentage
of
the
building
's
appreciation
or
a
fixed
return
. . O

The
main
advantage
of
a
convertible
mortgage
is
that
it
is
not
a
sale
and
therefore
does
not
trigger
costly
transfer
taxes
and
reappraisal
. . O

Sears
said
it
would
put
the
110
tower
on
the
block
almost
a
year
ago
as
part
of
its
anti
restructuring
. . O

But
Japanese
institutions
shied
away
from
bidding
on
the
high
tower
out
of
fear
their
purchase
of
the
property
would
trigger
anti
sentiment
. . O

Last
summer
, , O
Sears
appeared
to
have
a
deal
with
Canadian
developer
Olympia
& CC
York
Developments
Ltd
. . O

But
that
deal
fell
through
in
September
after
it
became
clear
that
the
sale
would
lead
to
a
major
real
estate
tax
reassessment
, , O
raising
property
taxes
, , O
and
making
it
difficult
to
lease
the
building
at
competitive
prices
. . O

Real
estate
industry
executives
said
Sears
' POS
investment
banker
, , O
Goldman
, , I
Sachs
& CC
Co
, , O
sought
financing
in
Japan
. . O

However
, , O
Japanese
authorities
apparently
were
concerned
that
a
refinancing
also
would
attract
too
much
publicity
. . O

Sears
then
went
back
to
AEW
, , O
the
Boston
pension
adviser
that
had
proposed
a
convertible
debt
deal
during
the
first
round
of
bids
last
spring
. . O

AEW
has
$ $ B
3
billion
of
real
estate
investments
nationwide
, , O
according
to
a
spokesman
. . O

Tandy
Corp
said
it
signed
a
definitive
agreement
to
acquire
two
units
of
Datatronic
AB
of
Stockholm
for
cash
. . O

The
amount
was
n
disclosed
. . O

The
electronics
maker
and
retailer
previously
estimated
the
sale
price
at
between
$ $ I
100
million
and
$ $ I
200
million
for
Datatronic
's
Victor
microcomputer
and
Micronic
hand
computer
subsidiaries
. . O

In
addition
, , O
Tandy
will
acquire
rights
to
the
Victor
and
Micronic
names
for
computers
. . O

During
1988
, , O
the
Datatronic
subsidiaries
had
combined
sales
in
excess
of
$ $ B
200
million
. . O

The
transaction
will
give
Tandy
a
well
European
computer
brand
that
includes
2
dealers
and
distributors
marketing
to
medium
business
and
educational
institutions
. . O

Closing
of
the
transaction
is
subject
to
certain
conditions
and
regulatory
approvals
, , O
the
company
said
. . O

Two
rules
in
pending
congressional
legislation
threaten
to
hinder
leveraged
buy
by
raising
the
price
tags
of
such
deals
by
as

the
rules
, , O
which
would
curtail
the
tax
deductibility
of
debt
used
in
most
LBOs
. . O

The
provisions
, , O
in
deficit
bills
recently
passed
by
the
House
and
Senate
, , O
could
further
cool
the
takeover
boom
that
has
been
the
driving
force
behind
the
bull
market
in
stocks
for
much
of
the
1980s
, , O
some
tax
experts
and
investment
bankers
argue
. . O

Indeed
, , O
some
investment
bankers
have
already
started
restructuring
deals
to
cope
with
the
expected
rules
. . O

Wall
Street
has
all
but
conceded
on
the
issue
and
is
now
lobbying
for
the
less
onerous
Senate
version
of
one
of
the
provisions
. . O

At
issue
is
the
deductibility
of
certain
junk
bonds
that
are
used
in
most
LBOs
. . O

Such
high
debt
is
similar
to
a
zero
bond
in
that
it
is
sold
at
a
discount
to
face
value
, , O
with
interest
accruing
instead
of
being
paid
to
the
holder
. . O

Under
current
rules
, , O
that
accrued
interest
is
deductible
by
the
company
issuing
the
debt
. . O

The
House
version
of
the
legislation
would
kill
that
deduction
, , O
and
label
any
such
debt
as
equity
, , O
which
is
n
deductible
. . O

The
less
Senate
version
would
defer
the
deductibility
for
roughly
five
years
. . O

`` `` O
You
see
these
in
just
about
every
LBO
, , O
'' '' O
said
Robert
Willens
, , O
senior
vice
president
in
charge
of
tax
issues
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc
in
New
York
. . O

`` `` O
It
becomes
a
source
of
cash
'' '' O
for
the
company
making
the
LBO
because
it
gets
a
deduction
and
does
n
have
to
repay
the
debt
for
several
years
. . O

Typically
, , O
Mr
Willens
estimates
, , O
this
type
of
debt
makes
up
15
% NN
to
20
% NN
of
the
financing
for
LBOs
. . O

These
types
of
bonds
have
been
used
in
buy
of
companies
such
as
RJR
Nabisco
Inc
, , O
Storer
Communications
Inc
and
Kroger
Co
. . O

A
second
provision
passed
by
the
Senate
and
House
would
eliminate
a
rule
allowing
companies
that
post
losses
resulting
from
LBO
debt
to
receive
refunds
of
taxes
paid
over
the
previous
three
years
. . O

For
example
, , O
if
a
company
posted
a
loss
of
$ $ B
100
million
from
buy
interest
payments
, , O
the
existing
rule
would
allow
the
concern
to
be
able
to
receive
a
refund
from
the
tax
it
paid
from
1986
through
1989
, , O
when
it
may
have
been
a
profitable
public
company
. . O

But
that
rule
is
being
virtually
overlooked
by
Wall
Street
, , O
which
is
concentrating
on
coping
with
the
deduction
issue
. . O

`` `` O
Prices
for
LBOs
have
to
come
down
if
you
do
n
have
that
feature
, , O
'' '' O
argued
Lawrence
Schloss
, , O
managing
director
for
merchant
banking
at
Donaldson
, , I
Lufkin
& CC
Jenrette
Securities
Corp
in
New
York
. . O

Several
Wall
Street
officials
say
the
proposed
legislation
already
is
having
an
impact
. . O

An
investment
group
led
by
Chicago
's
Pritzker
family
recently
lowered
a
$ $ I
3
billion
bid
for
American
Medical
International
, , O
Beverly
Hills
, , O
Calif
, , O
because
of
the
threat
of
the
legislation
. . O

Moreover
, , O
one
investment
banker
, , O
who
requested
anonymity
, , O
said
his
firm
did
n
raise
the
ante
for
a
target
company
earlier
this
month
after
a
stronger
bid
emerged
from
a
public
company
that
was
n
concerned
about
the
financing
provision
. . O

`` `` O
We
would
have
paid
more
if
we
thought
that
law
was
n
going
to
pass
, , O
'' '' O
he
said
. . O

One
possible
solution
for
Wall
Street
is
to
increase
the
equity
part
of
the
transaction
-- : O
that
is
, , O
give
lenders
a
bigger
stake
in
the
surviving
company
rather
than
just
interest
payments
. . O

That
would
force
the
buy
firm
and
the
target
company
's
management
to
reduce
their
level
of
ownership
. . O

`` `` O
The
pigs
in
the
trough
may
have
to
give
a
little
bit
of
the
slop
back
and
then
the
deal
can
go
through
, , O
'' '' O
said
Peter
C
Canellos
, , O
tax
partner
at
Wachtell
, , I
Lipton
, , I
Rosen
& CC
Katz
. . O

Another
solution
, , O
said
a
tax
lawyer
who
requested
anonymity
, , O
is
for
firms
to
use
convertible
bonds
that
sell
at
a
discount
. . O

Since
they
have
a
lower
interest
rate
, , O
they
would
n
fall
under
the
junk
category
that
would
lose
its
deductibility
. . O

The
House
version
of
the
bill
would
make
debt
non
if
it
pays
five
percentage
points
above
Treasury
notes
, , O
has
at
least
a
five
maturity
and
does
n
pay
interest
for
at
least
one
year
out
of
the
first
five
. . O

The
bill
would
then
declare
that
the
debt
is
equity
and
therefore
is
n
deductible
. . O

The
Senate
bill
would
only
deny
the
deduction
until
interest
is
actually
paid
. . O

Currently
, , O
even
though
the
issuer
does
n
pay
tax
, , O
the
debt
holder
is
taxed
on
the
accrued
interest
. . O

But
those
holders
are
often
foreign
investors
and
tax
pension
funds
that
do
n
pay
taxes
on
their
holdings
. . O

The
Senate
estimates
that
its
version
of
the
provision
would
yield
$ $ B
17
million
the
first
year
and
a
total
of
$ $ B
409
million
over
five
years
. . O

The
House
version
would
raise
slightly
more
. . O

Even
if
Wall
Street
finds
ways
around
the
new
rules
, , O
a
Senate
aide
contends
LBOs
will
become
somewhat
more
difficult
. . O

`` `` O
There
's
no
question
it
will
make
LBOs
more
expensive
, , O
'' '' O
he
said
. . O

`` `` O
The
interest
deduction
was
the
engine
that
made
these
things
more
productive
. . O

The
average
publicly
offered
commodity
fund
fell
4
% NN
in
September
, , O
largely
because
of
the
volatile
markets
in
foreign
currencies
, , O
according
to
Norwood
Securities
. . O

The
firm
said
that
losers
outnumbered
gainers
by
more
than
three
to
one
among
the
122
funds
it
tracks
. . O

For
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
, , O
Norwood
said
the
average
fund
has
lost
3
% NN
. . O

The
government
moved
aggressively
to
open
the
spigots
of
federal
aid
for
victims
of
the
California
earthquake
, , O
but
its
reservoir
of
emergency
funds
must
be
replenished
soon
if
the
aid
is
to
continue
. . O

President
Bush
signed
a
disaster
declaration
covering
seven
Northern
California
counties
. . O

The
declaration
immediately
made
the
counties
eligible
for
temporary
housing
, , O
grants
and
low
loans
to
cover
uninsured
property
losses
. . O

In
addition
, , O
an
unusually
wide
array
of
federal
agencies
moved
to
provide
specialized
assistance
. . O

The
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
prepared
to
make
as
many
as
100
vacant
houses
available
for
those
left
homeless
, , O
the
Agriculture
Department
was
set
to
divert
food
from
the
school
program
to
earthquake
victims
, , O
and
the
Pentagon
was
providing
everything
from
radio
communications
to
blood
transfusions
to
military
police
for
directing
traffic
. . O

But
the
pool
of
federal
emergency
funds
already
is
running
low
because
of
the
heavy
costs
of
cleaning
up
Hurricane
Hugo
, , O
and
Congress
will
be
under
pressure
to
allocate
more
money
quickly
. . O

In
Hugo
's
wake
, , O
Congress
allocated
$ $ B
1
billion
in
relief
funds
, , O
and
White
House
spokesman
Marlin
Fitzwater
said
$ $ B
273
million
of
that
money
remains
and
could
be
diverted
for
quick
expenditures
related
to
the
earthquake
. . O

Now
, , O
though
, , O
enormous
costs
for
earthquake
relief
will
pile
on
top
of
outstanding
costs
for
hurricane
relief
. . O

`` `` O
That
obviously
means
that
we
wo
n
have
enough
for
all
of
the
emergencies
that
are
now
facing
us
, , O
and
we
will
have
to
consider
appropriate
requests
for
follow
funding
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Fitzwater
said
. . O

The
federal
government
is
n
even
attempting
yet
to
estimate
how
much
the
earthquake
will
cost
it
. . O

But
Mr
Fitzwater
said
, , O
`` `` O
There
will
be
, , O
I
think
quite
obviously
, , O
a
very
large
amount
of
money
required
from
all
levels
of
government
. . O
'' '' O

In
Congress
, , O
lawmakers
already
are
looking
for
ways
to
add
relief
funds
. . O

Money
could
be
added
to
a
pending
spending
bill
covering
the
Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency
, , O
which
coordinates
federal
disaster
relief
. . O

More
likely
, , O
relief
funds
could
be
added
to
an
omnibus
spending
bill
that
Congress
is
to
begin
considering
next
week

But
it
is
n
just
Washington
's
relief
dollars
that
are
spread
thin
; : O
its
relief
manpower
also
is
stretched
. . O

FEMA
still
has
special
disaster
centers
open
to
handle
the
aftermath
of
Hugo
, , O
and
spokesman
Russell
Clanahan
acknowledged
that
`` `` O
we
're
pretty
thin
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Clanahan
says
FEMA
now
possibly
may
have
the
heaviest
caseload
in
its
history
. . O

To
further
complicate
relief
efforts
, , O
the
privately
funded
American
Red
Cross
also
finds
itself
strapped
for
funds
after
its
big
Hugo
operation
. . O

`` `` O
It
's
been
a
bad
month
money
and
every
other
way

'' '' O
said
Sally
Stewart

a
spokeswoman
for
the
Red
Cross

`` `` O
It
just
makes
it
a
little
rough
when
you
have
to
worry
about
the
budget

'' '' O

The
Red
Cross
has
opened
30
shelters
in
the
Bay
area
, , O
serving
5
people

Twenty
trucks
capable
of
cooking
food
were
dispatched
from
other
states

All
the
precise
types
of
federal
aid
that
will
be
sent
to
California
wo
n
be
determined
until
state
officials
make
specific
requests
to
FEMA
, , O
agency
officials
said
. . O

And
in
the
confusion
after
the
earthquake
, , O
`` `` O
the
information
flow
is
a
little
slow
coming
in
from
the
affected
area
, , O
'' '' O
said
Carl
Suchocki
, , O
a
FEMA
spokesman
. . O

Still
, , O
some
aid
is
moving
westward
from
Washington
almost
immediately
. . O

HUD
officials
said
they
will
make
available
as
many
as
100
Bay
area
houses
that
are
under
HUD
loans
but
now
are
vacant
after
the
houses
have
been
inspected
to
ensure
they
are
sound
. . O

Additional
housing
vouchers
and
certificates
will
be
made
available
, , O
officials
said
, , O
and
some
housing
and
community
funds
may
be
shifted
from
other
programs
or
made
available
for
emergency
use
. . O

Another
federal
agency
not
normally
associated
with
disaster
relief
-- : O
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
-- : O
moved
quickly
as
well
. . O

The
IRS
said
it
will
waive
certain
tax
penalties
for
earthquake
victims
unable
to
meet
return
deadlines
or
make
payments
because
of
the
quake
's
devastation
. . O

The
agency
plans
to
announce
specific
relief
procedures
in
the
coming
days
. . O

And
the
Treasury
said
residents
of
the
San
Francisco
area
will
be
able
to
cash
in
savings
bonds
even
if
they
have
n
held
them
for
the
minimum
six
period
. . O

One
advantage
that
federal
officials
have
in
handling
earthquake
relief
is
the
large
number
of
military
facilities
in
the
San
Francisco
Bay
area
, , O
facilities
that
provide
a
ready
base
of
supplies
and
workers

Even
before
the
full
extent
of
the
devastation
was
known
, , O
Defense
Secretary
Dick
Cheney
ordered
the
military
services
to
set
up
an
emergency
command
center
in
the
Pentagon
and
prepare
to
respond
to
various
FEMA
requests
for
assistance

By
yesterday
afternoon

Air
Force
transport
planes
began
moving
additional
rescue
and
medical
supplies
, , I
physicians
, , I
communications
equipment
and
FEMA
personnel
to
California

A
military
jet
flew
a
congressional
delegation
and
senior
Bush
administration
officials
to
survey
the
damage

And
the
Pentagon
said
dozens
of
additional

aircraft
were
on

Air
Force
Base

50

northeast

Letterman
Army
Medical

In

20
military
police
from
the
Presidio

a
military

To
help
residents
in
Northern
California
rebuild
, , O
FEMA
intends
to
set
up
17
disaster
assistance
offices
in
the
earthquake
area
in
the
next
several
days
and
to
staff
them
with
400

500
workers
from
various
agencies

Robert
Volland
, , O
chief
of
the
agency

individual
assistance
division

At
these

earthquake
victims
will
be
helped
in
filling
out
a
one
form
that
they
will
need
to
qualify
for
such
federal
assistance
as
home
loans
and
to
repair
houses

And
federal
officials
are
promising
to
move
rapidly
with
federal
highway
aid
to
rebuild
the
area
's
severely
damaged
road
system

The
Federal
Highway
Administration
has
an
emergency
relief
program
to
help
states
and
local
governments
repair
federally
funded
highways
and
bridges
seriously
damaged
by
natural
disasters
. . O

The
account
currently
has
$ $ B
220
million

And
though
federal
law
dictates
that
only
$ $ I
100
million
can
be
disbursed
from
that
fund
in
any
one
state
per
disaster
, , O
administration
officials
expect
Congress
to
move
in
to
authorize
spending
more
now
in
California
. . O

To
get
that
money
, , O
states
must
go
through
an
elaborate
approval
process
, , O
but
officials
expect
red
tape
to
be
cut
this
time
. . O

Keith
Mulrooney
, , O
special
assistant
to
Federal
Highway
Administrator
Thomas
Larson
, , O
also
said
that
after
the
1971
San
Fernando
earthquake
in
Southern
California
, , O
the
state
set
tougher
standards
for
bridges
, , O
and
with
federal
aid

began
a
program
to
retrofit
highways

bridges
for
earthquake
hazards

The
first
phase
of
the
program
has
been
completed

two
other
phases

The
two
major

Other

completely
idled
their
operations
because
of
Tuesday
evening
's
temblor

which
registered

Personnel

mopping
up
water
from
broken
pipes

clearing
ceiling
tiles

Still

confident
that
`` `` O
in

signaled
that

Digital
Equipment
Corp
, , O
with
major
facilities
in
Santa
Clara
, , O
Cupertino
, , O
Palo
Alto

Mountain
View

said
that

Mass
, , O
Tuesday
night

None
sustained
`` `` B
significant
'' '' I
damage

a
spokesman
said
, , O
adding
that
`` `` O
the
delicate
manufacturing
process

were
checked

were
all
found
to
be
operating
normally

'' '' O

For
many
companies
, , O
of
course
, , O
there
is
still
a
slew
of
nagging
problems
to
grapple
with
, , O
some
of
which
have
the
potential
to
become
quite
serious
. . O

For
example
, , O
a
spokesman
for
Advanced
Micro
Devices
said
the
Sunnyvale
chip
maker
is
worried
about
blackouts
. . O

A
sudden
surge
or
drop
in
electric
power
could
ruin
integrated
circuits
being
built
. . O

But
, , O
given
what
might
have
happened
to
the
fragile
parts
that
are
at
the
heart
of
the
microelectronics
business
, , O
the
bulk
of
Valley
companies
seemed
to
be
just
about
shouting
hosannas
. . O

Several
factors
apparently
spared
the
Valley
-- : O
a
sprawling
suburban
stretch
from
San
Jose
to
Palo
Alto
-- : O
from
the
kind
of
impact
felt
in
San
Francisco
, , O
an
hour
's
drive
north
. . O

For
one
thing
, , O
buildings
there
tend
to
be
newer
and
, , O
thus
, , O
in
step
with
the
latest
safety
codes
. . O

Also
, , O
the
soil
in
the
Valley
is
solid
, , O
unlike
the
landfill
of
San
Francisco
's
downtown
Marina
District
, , O
which
was
hit
with
fires
and
vast
destruction
. . O

In
addition
, , O
some
microelectronics
companies
said
they
were
prepared
for
tremulous
conditions
like
Tuesday
's
. . O

Their
machine
tools
are
even
bolted
to
the
shop
floor
. . O

Intel
said
that
over
the
past
decade
, , O
it
has
installed
computer
sensors
and
shutoff
valves
, , O
sensitive
to
the
shake
of
an
earthquake
, , O
in
the
pipes
that
snake
through
its
plants
. . O

Like
other
large
Valley
companies
, , O
Intel
also
noted
that
it
has
factories
in
several
parts
of
the
nation
, , O
so
that
a
breakdown
at
one
location
should
n
leave
customers
in
a
total
pinch
. . O

That
's
certainly
good
news
for
such
companies
as
Compaq
Computer
Corp
, , O
Houston
, , O
which
has
only
a
four
supply
of
microprocessors
from
the
Valley
on
hand
because
of
a
just
manufacturing
approach
that
limits
the
buildup
of
inventory
. . O

Compaq
said
it
foresees
no
difficulties
in
obtaining
parts
in
the
immediate
future
. . O

Computer
makers
were
scrambling
to
help
customers
recover
from
the
disaster
. . O

Digital
Equipment
has
set
up
disaster
response
centers
in
Dallas
, , O
Atlanta
and
Colorado
Springs
, , O
Colo
. . O

These
units
were
handling
calls
both
from
people
in
the
San
Francisco
area
and
from
computers
themselves
, , O
which
are
set
to
dial
Digital
automatically
when
trouble
arises
. . O

They
then
run
remotely
controlled
self
programs
. . O

Digital
also
said
it
has
dispatched
teams
of
technicians
to
California
. . O

Meanwhile
, , O
several
other
major
installations
around
the
Valley
-- : O
America
's
center
of
high
-- : O
said
they
, , O
too
, , O
fared
as
well
as
could
be
expected
. . O

Lawrence
Livermore
National
Laboratory
, , O
where
the
Energy
Department
tests
and
conducts
research
on
nuclear
weapons
, , O
had
only
`` `` O
superficial
damage
, , O
'' '' O
a
spokesman
said
. . O

At
Lockheed
Corp
's
missiles
and
space
systems
group
in
Sunnyvale
, , O
about
40
miles
south
of
San
Francisco
, , O
workers
were
asked
to
head
to

yesterday
after
it
was
realized
that
`` `` O
there
were
no
show
'' '' O
in
the
150
buildings
on
its
one
campus
. . O

Several
engineering
and
research
offices
needed
closer
scrutiny
to
make
sure
they
were
n
in
danger
of
crumbling
, , O
but
`` `` O
the
bulk
of
the
place
is
in
pretty
good
shape

'' '' O
an
official
said

One
of
Lockheed

most
lucrative

for
more
than
half
the

John
R
Wilke
contribued
to
this
article
. . O

Michael
Maynard
offered
the
world
a
faster
way
to
break
eggs
. . O

As
thanks
, , O
the
egg
industry
tried
to
break
him
. . O

And
the
egg
producers
have
done
a
pretty
good
job
. . O

They
tried
to
put
Mr
Maynard
out
of
business
by
an
act
of
Congress
. . O

Egg
lobbying
helped
persuade
six
states
to
ban
Mr
Maynard
's
automatic
egg
machine
because
of
fears
over
salmonella
. . O

His
company
, , O
Misa
Manufacturing
Inc
, , O
was
forced
to
seek
protection
from
creditors
under
federal
bankruptcy
law
in
1987
and
has
since
been
liquidated
. . O

Monthly
sales
of
his
Egg
King
machine
-- : O
which
he
now
is
marketing
through
a
new
company
-- : O
have
sunk
to
about
half
a
dozen
from
a
peak
of
75
, , O
says
the
46
businessman
. . O

Mr
Maynard
is
n
the
first
entrepreneur
to
bump
up
against
entrenched
interests
. . O

But
his
case
is
notable
both
for
the
scale
of
the
fight
-- : O
it
is
n
often
that
a
congressional
hearing
is
held
to
determine
whether
one
small
businessman
is
a
threat
to
the
republic
-- : O
and
for
what
it
tells
about
the
pitfalls
of
marketing
a
new
product
. . O

Now
one
might
ask
why
people
who
sell
eggs
would
fight
someone
who
is
trying
to
make
it
easier
to
crack
them
. . O

Part
of
the
answer
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
industry
. . O

Many
larger
egg
producers
are
also
egg
processors
, , O
who
crack
, , I
inspect
, , I
and
sanitize
billions
of
eggs
, , O
turning
them
into
powdered
, , I
liquified
or
frozen
egg
products
. . O

However
, , O
dozens
of
bakers
, , O
restaurant
chefs
and
other
food
preparers
who
flocked
to
Mr
Maynard
's
defense
say
that
products
ranging
from
egg
bread
to
eclairs
lose
some
zip
when
the
eggs
come
in
30
cans
instead
of
shells
. . O

But
for
companies
that
use
hundreds
of
eggs
a
day
, , O
breaking
them
by
hand
can
get
, , O
well
, , O
out
of
hand
. . O

The
idea
behind
the
Egg
King
is
pretty
simple
: : O
put
the
eggs
into
a
cylinder
that
contains
perforated
baskets
, , O
spin
them
at
a
high
speed
to
break
the
shells
and
strain
the
edible
part
through
the
baskets
. . O

One
Egg
King
-- : O
which
at
just
under
four
feet
tall
and
two
feet
wide
has
been
likened
to
the
robot
R2
-- : O
can
crack
about
20
eggs
an
hour
. . O

Because
fresh
eggs
are
less
expensive
than
processed
ones
, , O
a
big
egg
user
can
recover
the
Egg
King
's
$ $ B
3
cost
in
a
few
months
, , O
says
Mr
Maynard
. . O

Such
centrifugal
egg
breakers
have
been
around
since
the
1890s
. . O

But
when
Mr
Maynard
came
forward
with
his
machine
in
the
early
1970s
nobody
else
was
offering
them
in
the
U
. . O

The
main
reason
: : O
salmonella
. . O

Chickens
carry
this
bacteria
, , O
which
can
cause
upset
stomachs
and
, , O
in
rare
cases
, , O
death
among
people
. . O

Hens
sometimes
pass
salmonella
to
the
eggs
, , O
and
it
can
also
be
found
on
unclean
shells
. . O

Thus
, , O
any
machine
that
breaks
large
amounts
of
eggs
at
once
has
the
potential
to
spread
salmonella
if
a
bad
egg
gets
in
with
the
good
ones
. . O

Mr
Maynard
claims
this
is
a
manageable
problem
. . O

The
Egg
King
carries
written
instructions
to
break
only
high
eggs
that
have
been
properly
sanitized
and
, , O
as
an
added
precaution
, , B
to
use
the
eggs
only
in
products
that
will
be
cooked
enough
to
kill
bacteria
. . O

With
nearly
4
machines
in
use
, , O
there
have
been
no
salmonella
problems
as
long
as
instructions
were
followed
, , O
Mr
Maynard
boasts
. . O

He
says
the
handful
of
salmonella
cases
involving
products
that
may
have
used
eggs
broken
by
an
Egg
King
stemmed
from
a
failure
to
adequately
cook
the
products
. . O

But
he
says
that
's
no
more
a
reason
for
banning
Egg
Kings
than
bad
drivers
are
a
reason
for
banning
cars
. . O

Opponents
do
n
buy
such
arguments
. . O

`` `` O
Human
nature
being
what
it
is
, , O
people
do
n
always
follow
instructions
, , O
'' '' O
says
Jack
Guzewich
, , O
chief
of
food
protection
for
the
New
York
state
Health
Department
. . O

Leading
the
assault
against
the
Egg
King
has
been
United
Egg
Producers
. . O

The
Decatur
, , I
Ga
, , I
trade
group
has
issued
a
`` `` I
briefing
book
'' '' O
that
claims
the
machine
is
`` `` O
a
health
hazard
'' '' O
and
that
Mr
Maynard
is
trying
`` `` O
to
make
a
fast
buck
at
the
expense
of
the
nation
's
egg
producers
. . O
'' '' O

The
UEP
declines
to
comment
, , O
but
the
group
's
attorney
, , O
Alfred
Frawley
, , O
says
the
group
's
actions
are
motivated
solely
by
`` `` O
health
concerns
. . O
'' '' O

An
early
battleground
was
the
U
Department
of
Agriculture
. . O

Mr
Maynard
initially
won
approval
for
his
machine
to
be
used
at
egg
facilities
regulated
by
the
USDA
's
Food
Safety
Inspection
Service
. . O

Unfortunately
for
Mr
Maynard
, , O
another
branch
of
the
USDA
, , O
the
Agricultural
Marketing
Service
, , O
was
in
charge
of
eggs
. . O

After
receiving
complaints
from
egg
producers
, , O
this
branch
got
the
other
branch
to
rescind
its
approval
, , O
thus
limiting
the
machine
's
potential
market
to
bakeries
and
restaurants
and
other
establishments
that
are
n
regulated
by
the
USDA
. . O

The
egg
producers
also
lobbied
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
. . O

But
the
FDA
in
a
1985
letter
to
the
United
Egg
Producers
said
that
there
was
`` `` O
little
likelihood
'' '' O
of
a
health
problem
as
long
as
instructions
were
followed
. . O

So
the
producers
went
to
Capitol
Hill
, , O
where
a
congressman
from
Georgia
introduced
a
measure
to
ban
centrifugal
egg
machines
. . O

Mr
Maynard
, , O
whose
company
at
the
time
was
based
in
Santa
Ana
, , O
Calif
, , O
enlisted
his
local
congressman
, , O
and
the
battle
was
joined
. . O

Mr
Maynard
's
forces
finally
defeated
the
measure
, , O
though
it
took
a
vote
on
the
floor
of
the
House
of
Representatives
to
do
it
. . O

Even
then
, , O
opponents
managed
to
get
a
congressional
hearing
to
examine
what
one
congressman
called
an
`` `` I
unscrupulous
'' '' I
method
for
breaking
eggs
. . O

Foiled
in
their
effort
to
get
a
national
ban
, , O
the
egg
producers
turned
their
attention
to
the
states
. . O

So
far
, , O
New
York
, , O
New
Jersey
, , O
Nebraska
, , O
Georgia
, , O
Michigan
and
Minnesota
have
outlawed
Mr
Maynard
's
device
, , O
citing
health
concerns
. . O

An
antitrust
suit
that
Mr
Maynard
's
company
filed
in
Los
Angeles
federal
court
against
the
United
Egg
Producers
and
others
only
added
to
the
entrepreneur
's
woes
. . O

The
judge
dismissed
the
suit
and
ordered
Mr
Maynard
's
company
to
pay
over
$ $ I
100
in
legal
fees
to
the
defendants
' POS
lawyers
. . O

Mr
Maynard
says
the
ruling
pushed
his
company
into
bankruptcy
court
. . O

Now
he
has
moved
to
Oklahoma
where
costs
are
lower
, , O
and
started
a
new
company
, , O
Adsi
Inc
, , O
to
market
his
machine
. . O

But
, , O
so
far
, , O
the
change
of
scenery
has
n
ended
his
string
of
bad
breaks
. . O

Mr
Maynard
recently
fell
from
a
horse
and
fractured
his
arm
. . O

Michelle
Pfeiffer
ca
n
chew
gum
and
sing
at
the
same
time
. . O

But
on
the
evidence
of
`` `` O
The
Fabulous
Baker
Boys
, , O
'' '' O
that
may
be
the
only
thing
she
ca
n
do
, , O
at
least
when
she
's
acting
in
movies
. . O

As
the
tough
, , I
slinky
lounge
chanteuse
in
`` `` O
The
Fabulous
Baker
Boys
, , O
'' '' O
Ms
Pfeiffer
sings
for
herself
, , O
and
more
than
passably
well
. . O

Her
Susie
Diamond
handles
a
song
the
way
the
greats
do
, , O
like
she
's
hearing
the
way
it
should
sound
inside
her
head
and
she
's
concentrating
on
matching
that
internal
tone
. . O

Yet
her
intensity
stops
and
starts
with
the
music
. . O

When
she
is
n
performing
for
an
audience
, , O
she
prepares
for
a
song
by
removing
the
wad
of
gum
from
her
mouth
, , O
and
indicates
that
she
's
finished
by
sticking
the
gum
back
in
. . O

Like
almost
everything
in
this
wonderfully
romantic
and
edgy
movie
, , O
Ms
Pfeiffer
's
Susie
seems
like
someone
you
've
seen
before
, , O
in
numerous
show
stories
-LRB
even
her
name
, , O
Susie
Diamond
, , O
sounds
like
a
character
Marilyn
Monroe
must
have
played
-RRB
. . O

Yet
nothing
about
`` `` O
Baker
Boys
, , O
'' '' O
and
certainly
nothing
about
Ms
Pfeiffer
, , O
really
is
like
something
from
the
video
vault
. . O

Steve
Kloves
, , O
the
young

he
is

'' '' O
a
lovely
coming
picture
set
in
the
'40s
. . O

Both
movies
are
infused
with
the
nostalgic
sensibility
of
someone
much
older
, , O
someone
who
does
n
dismiss
dreams
, , O
but
who
also
has
enough
experience
to
see
his
limits
. . O

However
, , O
Mr
Kloves
directs
his
own
material
without
sentimentality
and
at
its
own
eccentric
pace
; : O
`` `` O
Baker
Boys
'' '' O
is
both
bluesy
and
funny
. . O

He
's
put
a
fresh
spin
on
material
that
could
come
off
terribly
cliched
; : O
for
example
, , O
the
way
Susie
wows
an
audience
the
first
time
she
sings
with
the
Baker
Boys
. . O

Of
course
, , O
it
does
n
hurt
that
Mr
Kloves
has
made
up
for
his
lack
of
experience
behind
the
camera
with
technicians
who
know
exactly
what
they
're
doing
. . O

Much
of
the
picture
's
sensuality
emerges
from
cinematographer
Michael
Ballhaus
's
slyly
seductive
lens
work
. . O

After
working
for
years
with
Werner
Rainer
Fassbinder
, , O
the
late
German
director
, , B
and
more
recently
with
Martin
Scorsese
-LRB
`` `` O
After
Hours
, , O
'' '' O
`` `` O
The
Color
of
Money
, , O
'' '' O
`` `` O
The
Last
Temptation
of
Christ
'' '' O
-RRB
, , O
Mr
Ballhaus
has
developed
a
distinctively
fluid
style
. . O

And
Dave
Grusin
's
witty
score
embraces
the
banal
requirements
of
banquet
musicianship
-LRB
`` `` O
Feelings
'' '' O
is
a
must
-RRB
without
condescension
. . O

Though
Ms
Pfeiffer
has
the
flashy
part
-- : O
she
gets
the
best
comic
bits
and
to
wear
glamorous
dresses
and
spiked
heels
the
boys
are
pretty
great
, , O
too
. . O

What
seemed
like
a
good
idea
, , O
to
cast
the
Bridges
brothers
-LRB
Jeff
and
Beau
-RRB
as
the
Baker
brothers
, , O
actually
turned
out
to
be
a
good
idea
. . O

Anyone
who
's
tried
to
appear
`` `` O
natural
'' '' O
in
front
of
a
camera
knows
that
it
's
much
more
natural
to
end
up
looking
like
a
stiff
. . O

So
it
's
quite
possible
that
the
terrific
play
between
the
brothers
is
n
natural
at
all
, , O
that
Jeff
and
Beau
had
to
work
like
crazy
to
make
their
brotherly
love
-- : O
and
resentment
and
frustration
and
rage
-- : O
seem
so
very
real
. . O

When
the
movie
opens
the
Baker
brothers
are
doing
what
they
've
done
for
15
years
professionally
, , O
and
twice
as
long
as
that
for
themselves
: : O
They
're
playing
proficient
piano
, , O
face
, , O
on
twin
pianos
. . O

They
're
small
time
in
the
small
time
-LRB
not
the
best
ones
-RRB
and
restaurants
in
Seattle
. . O

Yet
they
do
n
disparage
their
audiences
by
disparaging
their
act
. . O

They
wear
tuxedos
most
nights
, , O
unless
circumstances
-LRB
a
regular
gig
at
a
`` `` I
tropical
'' '' I
lounge
, , O
for
example
-RRB
require
them
to
wear
special
costumes
, , O
like
Hawaiian
shirts
. . O

Plump
Beau
, , O
looking
eager
to
please
with
his
arched
eyebrows
and
round
face
, , O
plays
the
older
brother
, , O
Frank
. . O

Frank
plans
the
program
, , O
takes
care
of
business
, , O
and
approaches
the
work
like
any
other
job
. . O

He
's
even
able
to
think
of
a
job
that
takes
him
out
of
the
house
300
nights
a
week
as
an
ordinary
job
. . O

He
's
got
a
wife
and
two
kids
and
a
house
in
the
suburbs
; : O
the
audience
sees
only
the
house
, , O
and
only
near
the
end
of
the
movie
. . O

Frank
grovels
a
little
for
the
bookers
, , O
probably
no
more
or
less
than
he
would
have
to
if
he
worked
for
a
big
corporation
. . O

On
his
off
he
wears
cardigan
sweaters
. . O

Jeff
Bridges
is
the
younger
brother
, , O
Jack
, , O
who
fancies
himself
the
rebellious
artist
; : O
he
lives
in
a
loft
with
his
sick
dog
and
the
occasional
visit
from
the
little
girl
upstairs
, , O
who
climbs
down
the
fire
escape
. . O

Yet
Jack
's
the
one
who
can
remember
every
dive
they
ever
played
, , O
and
when
, , O
and
he
dutifully
shows
up
for
work
night
after
night
-LRB
he
consoles
himself
with
booze
and
by
showing
up
at
the
last
minute
-RRB
. . O

Looking
leaner
than
he
has
in
a
while
, , O
the
younger
Mr
Bridges
's
Jack
is
sexy
and
cynical
and
a
far
sadder
case
than
Frank
, , O
who
's
managed
to
chisel
his
dreams
to
fit
reality
without
feeling
too
cheated
. . O

He
can
live
with
little
pleasures
. . O

Mr
Kloves
has
put
together
some
priceless
moments
. . O

These
include
Jennifer
Tilly
's
audition
to
be
the
Baker
Boys
' POS
girl
singer
. . O

Ms
Tilly
of
the
tweety
voice
showed
great
comic
promise
during
her
stint
as
the
mobster
's
girlfriend
on
the
television
show
, , O
`` `` O
Hill
Street
Blues
. . O
'' '' O

Here
she
delivers
, , O
especially
during
her
enthusiastically
awful
rendition
of
the
`` `` I
Candy
Man
, , O
'' '' O
which
she
sings
while
prancing
around
in
a
little
cotton
candy
pink
angora
sweater
that
could
n
be
more
perfect
. . O

-LRB
It
matches
her
voice
. . O
-RRB

And
Ms
Pfeiffer
's
particular
version
of
`` `` O
Making
Whoopee
'' '' O
-- : O
and
the
way
Mr
Ballhaus
photographs
her
, , O
from
the
tips
of
her
red
high
heels
right
up
her
clingy
red
velvet
dress
-- : O
might
make
you
think
of
Marilyn
Monroe
if
Ms
Pfeiffer
had
n
gone
and
become
a
star
in
her
own
right

whose
Della

WCRS
agency
created
liar
Joe
Isuzu
, , O
among
others
-- : O
announced
a
massive
restructuring
that
largely
removes
it
from
the
advertising
business
and
includes
selling
the
majority
of
its
advertising
unit
to
Paris
Eurocom
. . O

The
complex
restructuring
, , O
which
was
long
expected
, , O
transforms
London
WCRS
from
primarily
a
creator
of
advertising
into
one
of
Europe
's
largest
buyers
of
advertising
time
and
space
. . O

It
also
creates
a
newly
merged
world
ad
agency
controlled
by
Eurocom
and
headed
jointly
by
New
York
ad
man
Jerry
Della
Femina
and
two
top
WCRS
executives
. . O

The
merged
agency
's
admittedly
ambitious
goal
: : O
to
become
one
of
the
world
's
10
largest
agencies
, , O
while
attracting
more
multinational
clients
than
the
agencies
were
able
to
attract
alone
. . O

WCRS
's
restructuring
reflects
the
growing
importance
of
media
buying
in
Europe
, , O
where
the
only
way
to
get
a
good
price
on
advertising
time
and
space
is
to
buy
it
in
bulk
. . O

For
Eurocom
, , O
meanwhile
, , O
the
move
gives
it
a
strong
U
foothold
in
Della
Femina
, , O
and
more
than
quadruples
the
size
of
its
ad
agency
business
world
. . O

It
also
gives
the
outspoken
Mr
Della
Femina
-- : O
who
often
generates
as
much
publicity
for
himself
as
for
his
clients
-- : O
an
international
platform
that
he
most
certainly
wo
n
be
loath
to
use
. . O

According
to
terms
, , O
WCRS
will
pay
2
billion
French
francs
-LRB
$ $ B
318
million
-RRB
for
the
50
% NN
it
does
n
already
own
of
Carat
Holding
S
, , O
one
of
Europe
's
largest
media
buyers
. . O

Meanwhile
, , O
Eurocom
, , O
which
had
held
20
% NN
of
WCRS
's
ad
unit
, , O
will
pay
# # B
43
million
-LRB
$ $ B
68
million
-RRB
to
raise
its
stake
to
60
% NN
. . O

That
price
also
covers
Eurocom
raising
to
60
% VB
its
51
% NN
stake
in
Europe
's
Belier
Group
, , O
a
joint
venture
ad
agency
network
it
owns
with
WCRS

Eurocom
will
also
have
the
right
to
buy
the
remaining
40
% NN
of
the
merged
ad
agency
group
in
six
years
. . O

The
transaction
places
the
three
executives
squarely
at
the
helm
of
a
major
agency
with
the
rather
unwieldy
name
of
Eurocom
WCRS
Della
Femina
Ball
Ltd
, , O
or
EWDB
. . O

The
merged
agency
will
include
Della
Femina
McNamee
based
in
New
York
, , O
Eurocom
's
various
agencies
in
France
, , O
the
Belier
Group
in
Europe
and
WCRS
's
other
advertising
and
direct
marketing
operations

Mr
Della
Femina
will
be
joint
chairman
with
former
WCRS
executive
Robin
Wight

Both
will
report
to
Tim
Breene
, , O
a
former
WCRS
executive
who
will
be
chief
executive
officer
at
the
new
agency
. . O

In
an
interview
in
New

, , O
Mr
Breene
, , O
fresh
from
a
Concorde
flight
from
Paris
where
executives
had
worked
through
most
of
the
night
, , O
outlined
big
plans
for
the
new
agency
. . O

`` `` O
Our
goal
is
to
develop
quite
rapidly
to
a
top
position
... : O
by
the
end
of
three
years
from
now
. . O

It
implies
very
dramatic
growth
, , O
'' '' O
he
said
. . O

He
added
that
Eurocom
and
WCRS
had
agreed
to
provide
a
development
fund
of
# # B
100
million
for
acquisitions
. . O

The
new
agency
group
is
already
in
discussions
about
a
possible
purchase
in
Spain
, , O
while
Mr
Breene
said
it
also
plans
to
make
acquisitions
in
Scandinavia
, , I
Germany
and
elsewhere
. . O

Cracking
the
top
10
within
three
years
will
be
difficult
at
best
. . O

Della
Femina
had
billings
of
just
$ $ I
660
million
last
year
and
ranked
as
the
U
's
24th
ad
agency
. . O

The
merged
company
that
it
now
becomes
part
of
will
have
billings
of
just
more
than
$ $ I
2
billion
-- : O
most
of
that
in
Europe
-- : O
bringing
it
to
about
14th
world
. . O

To
make
it
to
top
status
, , O
it
would
have
to
leapfrog
over
such
formidable
forces
as
Grey
Advertising
, , O
D
Masius
Benton
& CC
Bowles
and
Omnicom
's
DDB
Needham
. . O

The
merged
agency
's
game
plan
to
attract
multinational
packaged
advertisers
may
prove
equally
difficult
. . O

When
WCRS
created
Della
Femina
McNamee
out
of
the
merger
of
three
smaller
agency
units
in
1988
, , O
it
said
it
did
so
in
order
to
attract
larger
clients
, , O
especially
packaged
companies
. . O

Since
then
, , O
Della
Femina
won
Pan
Am
as
an
international
client
and
also
does
work
for
a
few
packaged
clients
, , O
including
Dow
Chemical
Co
's
Saran
Wrap
. . O

But
major
packaged
players
of
the
world
-- : O
such
as
Procter
& CC
Gamble
, , O
Colgate
and
Unilever
-- : O
have
steadfastly
eluded
the
agency
. . O

`` `` O
Three
of
our
favorite
names
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Della
Femina
calls
that
roster
, , O
adding
hopefully
, , O
`` `` O
We
're
a
much
more
attractive
agency
to
large
multinationals
today
than
we
were
yesterday
. . O
'' '' O

Still
, , O
the
restructuring
could
create
one
of
the
most
powerful
alliances
between
advertising
and
media
firms
that
Europe
has
seen
. . O

As
part
of
the
restructuring
, , O
WCRS
and
Eurocom
said
they
will
look
for
ways
to
combine
their
media
buying
across
Europe
. . O

What
's
more
, , O
both
Eurocom
and
brothers
Francis
and
Gilbert
Gross
, , O
who
founded
Carat
, , O
will
acquire
14
% NN
stakes
in
WCRS
Group
, , O
creating
a
powerful
link
between
Eurocom
and
Carat
. . O

Carat
will
receive
its
WCRS
stake
as
part
of
payment
for
the
50
% NN
Carat
stake
that
WCRS
is
buying
, , O
while
Eurocom
said
it
expects
to
pay
about
# # I
32
million
for
its
WCRS
stake
. . O

Mr
Della
Femina
says
he
plans
to
remain
heavily
involved
in
the
creative
product
at
the
world
agency
, , O
serving
as
a
sort
of
`` `` O
creative
conscience
. . O
'' '' O

Louise
McNamee
, , O
Della
Femina
's
president
, , O
will
continue
running
the
U
agency
day
. . O

They
and
other
top
executives
signed
long
employment
contracts
and
Mr
Della
Femina
will
receive
an
additional
multimillion
sum
, , O
which
some
industry
executives
pegged
at
about
$ $ I
10
million
. . O

WCRS
Group
, , O
for
its
part
, , O
will
now
be
able
to
follow
its
longstanding
plan
of
becoming
`` `` O
a
holding
company
for
a
series
of
media
businesses
, , O
'' '' O
said
Peter
Scott
, , O
the
firm
's
chief
executive
. . O

In
addition
to
Carat
, , O
WCRS
will
hold
onto
its
public
relations
, , I
TV
programming
and
other
businesses
. . O

WCRS
says
its
debt
will
be
cut
to
# # B
24
million
from
# # B
66
million
as
a
result
of
the
transaction
. . O

For
Carat
, , O
meanwhile
, , O
the
alliance
with
Eurocom
and
WCRS
is
intended
to
strengthen
its
own
push
outside
France
. . O

Carat
's
Gross
brothers
invented
the
idea
of
large
buying
of
media
space
. . O

By
buying
the
space
in
bulk
, , O
they
obtain
discounts
as
high
as
50
% NN
, , O
which
they
can
pass
on
to
customers
. . O

They
thus
have
won
the
French
space
business
of
such
advertising
giants
as
Coca
Co
, , O
Fiat
S
. . I
A
, , O
Gillette
and
Kodak
. . O

But
now
, , O
other
agencies
are
getting
into
the
business
with
their
own
competing
media
groups
-- : O
and
Carat
wants
to
expand
to
the
rest
of
Europe
. . O

To
help
finance
the
Carat
purchase
, , O
WCRS
said
it
plans
an
issue
of
Euroconvertible
preferred
shares
once
the
market
settles
down
. . O

But
WCRS
added
that
`` `` O
in
the
light
of
the
current
uncertainty
in
the
equity
markets
, , O
'' '' O
it
has
arranged
medium
debt
financing

which
would
be
underwritten
by

One
of
the
most
remarkable
features
of
the
forced
marches
of

ethnic
Turks
out

Bulgaria
over
the

has
been
the
lack
of
international
attention

The
deportation
of
more
than
315
men

women
and
children
by
the
Bulgarian
regime
adds
up
to
one
of
the
largest
migrations
seen
in
the
postwar
years
. . O

Yet
some
people
are
advancing
a
chilling
casuistry
: : O
that
what
we
are
seeing
is
somehow
the
understandable
result
of
the
historical
sins
committed
by
the
Turks
in
the
16th
century
. . O

Today
's
Turks
in
Bulgaria
, , O
in
other
words
, , O
deserve
what
is
coming
to
them
four
centuries
later
. . O

As
if
this
were
n
enough
, , O
the
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
is
getting
into
the
act

On

can

terrible
suffering

one
has
to
wonder
what
possible
good
such
a
resolution
will
achieve

It
puts
great
strain

longstanding
U

allies
in
NATO
. . O

The
resolution
also
comes
at
a
time
when
Turkey
has
been
seeking
help
from
the
United
States
in
resolving
its
Bulgarian
emigration
controversy
and
pursuing
democratic
reforms
that
may
lead
to
membership
in
the
European
Community
. . O

Turkey
has
been
fighting
its
past
for
years
, , O
and
thus
far
has
been
only
partially
successful
. . O

Must
it
now
accept
that
one
of
its
strongest
allies
blames
it
for
the
genocide
of
another
people
? . O

Such
sentiment
only
encourages
the
adverse
feelings
toward
Turkey
that
surfaced
when
Turkey
asked
for
assistance
in
dealing
with
its
Bulgarian
emigration
crisis
. . O

Mr
Dole
's
odd
effort
notwithstanding
, , O
most
of
Turkey
's
political
problems
lie
with
the
Europeans
. . O

Part
of
the
problem
some
Europeans
have
with
Turkey
seems
to
stem
from
its
location
-- : O
Turkey
is
n
really
part
of
Europe
. . O

Why
, , O
they
wonder
, , O
should
it
belong
to
the
EC
? . O

Another
anti
hook
is
the
Islamic
faith
of
the
majority
of
the
Turkish
people
: : O
Turkey
, , O
we
are
told
, , O
is
not
a
Christian
nation
; : O
its
people
simply
wo
n
fit
in
with
the
Western
European
Judeo
tradition
. . O

It
's
when
these
rationalizations
fall
on
deaf
ears
that
the
old
standby
of
retribution
for
treatment
at
the
hands
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
comes
to
the
fore
. . O

No
one
has
to
accept
the
sins
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
to
reject
that
argument
. . O

Turkey
in
any
event
is
long
past
it
. . O

The
country
has
in
recent
years
accepted
more
than
500
refugees
from
at
least
four
bordering
nations
. . O

Kurds
, , O
suffering
what
many
people
consider
to
be
a
current
extermination
campaign
at
the
hands
of
Syria
, , I
Iran
and
Iraq
have
inundated
eastern
Turkey
. . O

Now
it
is
their
fellow
Turks
arriving
as
refugees
from
Bulgaria
. . O

The
Turkish
refugee
tragedy
and
the
ongoing
crisis
can
not
be
ignored
and
shuttled
off
to
that
notorious
dustbin
of
history
that
has
become
so
convenient
recently
. . O

Surely
, , O
the
past
suffering
of
any
people
at
any
time
can
not
be
simply
filed
away
and
forgotten
. . O

But
what
the
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
has
done
in
supporting
the
strongly
worded
Armenian
resolution
achieves
no
useful
end
; : O
it
merely
produces
more
controversy
and
embittered
memories
. . O

Congress
has
enough
difficulty
dealing
with
the
realities
of
the
world
as
it
currently
exists
. . O

Bulgaria
's
government
has
been
behaving
beyond
the
pale
for
months
, , O
and
the
U
does
its
values
no
credit
by
ignoring
that
while
casting
its
votes
into
the
past
. . O

Many
in
Washington
say
President
Bush
will
have
to
raise
taxes
to
pay
for
his
war
on
drugs
. . O

We
have
a
better
idea
: : O
Dismantle
HUD
to
pay
for
the
war
on
drugs
. . O

Housing
and
Urban
Development
's
budget
is
$ $ B
17
billion
. . O

From
what
we
and
the
nation
have
been
reading
, , O
the
money
is
n
being
spent
very
well
. . O

The
single
most
important
contribution
the
government
could
make
now
to
help
the
poor
is
to
get
the
specter
of
drugs
out
of
their
neighborhoods
. . O

If
that
takes
money
, , O
take
it
away
from
this
discredited
federal
department
. . O

But
of
course
the
Democrats
pillorying
HUD
in
hearings
and
in
the
press
have
no
such
solution
in
mind
. . O

Instead
, , O
they
're
scrambling
to
protect
the
very
programs
at
the
heart
of
the
HUD
scandal
. . O

This
month
, , O
HUD
Secretary
Jack
Kemp
unveiled
a
series
of
proposed
reforms
to
improve
management
at
HUD
. . O

No
doubt
many
of
his
ideas
are
worthy
, , O
but
ultimately
he
is
proposing
to
make
fundamentally
flawed
programs
work
slightly
more
fairly
and
efficiently
. . O

Congress
is
unlikely
to
go
even
that
far
. . O

Last
week
, , O
Secretary
Kemp
ran
into
a
buzzsaw
of
criticism
from
House
Banking
Committee
members
. . O

They
were
appalled
, , O
for
instance
, , O
that
he
wanted
to
target
more
of
the
$ $ I
3
billion
Community
Development
Block
Grant
-LRB
CDBG
-RRB
program
to
low
projects
and
zero
out
the
notorious
`` `` I
discretionary
'' '' I
funds
that
have
allowed
HUD
officials
to
steer
contracts
to
political
cronies
. . O

These
development
grants
mainly
enrich
developers
who
want
to
put
up
shopping
centers
and
parking
garages
. . O

They
also
give
those
in
Congress
political
credit
for
bringing
home
the
pork
, , O
and
so
they
are
popular
with
such
Members
as
Mary
Rose
Oakar
. . O

Rep
Oakar
, , O
a
Democrat
from
Cleveland
, , O
wants
a
$ $ I
6
million
grant
so
Cleveland
can
build
an
18
Rock
and
Roll
Hall
of
Fame
. . O

She
says
it
'd
create
600
jobs
and
bring
Cleveland
tourist
revenue
. . O

HUD
says
the
project
does
n
qualify
, , O
and
Mr
Kemp
says
that
rock
'n
roll
musicians
and
the
music
industry
ought
to
put
up
the
money
. . O

At
the
hearing
, , O
Rep
Oakar
started
wailing
about
`` `` O
phoney
baloney
regulations
'' '' O
that
would
stand
between
her
and
`` `` O
housing
for
downtown
Cleveland
. . O
'' '' O

Rep
Chalmers
Wylie
, , O
an
Ohio
Republican
, , O
rallied
to
the
cause
: : O
`` `` O
I
think
the
gentlelady
is
making
an
important
statement
. . O

The
implication
that
if
a
congressman
calls
about
a
project
in
his
district
there
's
something
wrong
, , O
I
think
is
most
unfortunate
. . O
'' '' O

We
're
sure
some
theologian
can
explain
the
difference
between
what
the
Republican
consultants
have
been
doing
with
HUD
and
what
these
gentleladies
and
gentlemen
want
to
do
with
HUD
. . O

Our
view
is
that
given
Congress
's
attitude
toward
HUD
, , O
the
place
probably
is
beyond
reform
. . O

For
more
than
50
years
the
federal
government
has
tried
various
ways
to
provide
housing
for
the
poor
and
revive
cities
. . O

In
the
process
HUD
has
wasted
untold
billions
, , O
created
slums
and
invited
corruption
. . O

Much
of
HUD
's
spending
actually
is
disguised
welfare
for
developers
or
the
middle
class
. . O

That
includes
the
CDBG
funds
and
the
Federal
Housing
Administration
, , O
which
loans
out
money
for
private
home
mortgages
and
has
just
been
discovered
to
be
$ $ B
4
billion
in
the
hole
. . O

Selling
the
FHA
's
loan
portfolio
to
the
highest
bidder
would
save
the
taxpayers
untold
billions
in
future
losses
. . O

Some
HUD
money
actually
does
trickle
down
to
the
poor
, , O
and
zeroing
out
housing
middlemen
would
free
up
more
money
for
public
housing
tenants
to
manage
and
even
own
their
units
. . O

The
rest
ought
to
be
used
to
clean
out
drugs
from
the
neighbhorhoods
. . O

Rival
gangs
have
turned
cities
into
combat
zones
. . O

Even
suburban
Prince
George
's
County
, , O
Md
, , O
reported
last
week
there
have
been
a
record
96
killings
there
this
year
, , O
most
of
them
drug
. . O

Innocent
bystanders
often
are
the
victims
. . O

A
man
in
a
wheelchair
was
gunned
down
in
the
crossfire
of
a
Miami
drug
battle
. . O

A
three
Brooklyn
boy
was
used
as
a
shield
by
a
drug
dealer
. . O

Decent
life
in
the
inner
cities
wo
n
be
restored
unless
the
government
reclaims
the
streets
from
the
drug
gangs
. . O

Until
then
, , O
the
billions
HUD
spends
on
inner
housing
simply
is
wasted
. . O

It
's
still
unclear
whether
Secretary
Kemp
wants
to
completely
overhaul
the
engine
room
at
HUD
or
just
tighten
a
few
screws
here
and
there
. . O

No
doubt
he
believes
the
place
can
be
salvaged
. . O

Having
seen
the
hypocrisy
with
which
Congress
has
addressed
the
HUD
scandals
, , O
we
disagree
. . O

It
's
time
to
scrap
the
politically
infested
spending
machine
HUD
has
become
and
channel
the
resources
into
the
drug
war
. . O

Randy
Delchamps
was
named
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
this
grocery
chain
. . O

Mr
Delchamps
, , O
46
years
old
, , O
succeeds
A
Delchamps
Jr
, , O
who
died
in
a
plane
crash
on
Sunday
at
the
age
of
58
. . O

Randy
Delchamps
retains
his
position
as
president
. . O

Natural
upheavals
, , O
and
most
particularly
earthquakes
, , O
are
not
only
horrible
realities
in
and
of
themselves
, , O
but
also
symbols
through
which
the
state
of
a
society
can
be
construed
. . O

The
rubble
after
the
Armenian
earthquake
a
year
ago
disclosed
, , O
quite
literally
, , O
a
city
whose
larger
structures
had
been
built
with
sand
. . O

The
extent
of
the
disaster
stemmed
from
years
of
chicanery
and
bureaucratic
indifference
. . O

The
larger
parallel
after
the
earthquake
centered
south
of
San
Francisco
is
surely
with
the
state
of
the
U
economy
. . O

Did
the
stock
tremors
of
Friday
, , O
Oct
13
, , O
presage
larger
fragility
, , O
far
greater
upheavals
? . O

Are
the
engineering
and
architecture
of
the
economy
as
vulnerable
as
the
spans
of
the
Bay
Bridge
? . O

The
eerie
complacency
of
the
Reagan
era
has
produced
Panglossian
paeans
about
the
present
perfection
of
U
economic
and
social
arrangements
. . O

A
licensed
government
intellectual
, , O
Francis
Fukuyama
, , O
recently
announced
in
The
National
Interest
that
history
is
, , O
so
to
speak
, , O
at
an
end
since
the
course
of
human
progress
has
now
culminated
in
the
glorious
full
stop
of
American
civilization
. . O

His
observations
were
taken
seriously
. . O

But
we
are
, , O
in
reality
, , O
witnessing
the
continuing
decline
of
the
political
economy
of
capitalism
: : O
not
so
much
the
end
of
history
but
the
history
of
the
end
. . O

The
financial
equivalent
of
the
sand
used
by
those
Armenian
contractors
is
junk
bonds
and
the
leveraged
buy
associated
with
them
. . O

Builders
get
away
with
using
sand
and
financiers
junk
when
society
decides
it
's
okay
, , O
necessary
even
, , O
to
look
the
other
way
. . O

And
by
the
early
1980s
U
capitalists
had
ample
reason
to
welcome
junk
bonds
, , O
to
look
the
other
way
. . O

By
that
time
they
found
extremely
low
profit
rates
from
non
corporate
investment
. . O

Government
statistics
in
fact
show
that
the
profit
rate
-- : O
net
pretax
profits
divided
by
capital
stock
-- : O
peaked
in
1965
at
17
% NN
. . O

That
same
calculation
saw
profit
rates
fall
to
4
% NN
in
the
recession
year
1982
and
the
supposed
miracle
that
followed
has
seen
the
profit
rate
rise
only
to
8
% NN
in
1986
and
8
% NN
in
1987
. . O

Corresponding
to
the
fall
in
profit
rates
was
-- : O
in
the
early
1980s
-- : O
the
drop
in
the
number
arrived
at
if
you
divide
the
market
value
of
firms
by
the
replacement
costs
of
their
assets
, , O
the
famous
Q
ratio
associated
with
Prof
James
Tobin
. . O

In
theory
, , O
the
value
attached
to
a
firm
by
the
market
and
the
cost
of
replacing
its
assets
should
be
the
same
. . O

But
of
course
the
market
could
decide
that
the
firm
's
capital
stock
-- : O
its
assets
-- : O
means
nothing
if
the
firm
is
not
producing
profits
. . O

This
is
indeed
what
the
market
decided
. . O

By
1982
the
ratio
was
43
% NN
, , O
meaning
that
the
market
was
valuing
every
dollar
's
worth
of
the
average
firm
's
assets
at
43
cents
. . O

From
the
history
of
capitalism
we
can
take
it
as
a
sound
bet
that
if
it
takes
only
43
cents
to
buy
a
dollar
's
worth
of
a
firm
's
capital
stock
, , O
an
alert
entrepreneur
wo
n
look
the
other
way
. . O

His
assumption
is
that
the
underlying
profitability
rate
will
go
up
and
the
capital
assets
he
bought
on
the
cheap
will
soon
be
producing
profits
, , O
thus
restoring
the
market
's
faith
in
them
. . O

Hence
the
LBO
craze
. . O

But
here
is
where
the
entrepreneur
made
a
very
risky
bet
, , O
and
where
society
was
maybe
foolish
to
look
the
other
way
. . O

The
profit
rate
is
still
low
and
the
Q
ratio
was
only
65
% NN
in
1987
and
68
% NN
in
1988
. . O

Result
: : O
a
landscape
littered
with
lemons
, , O
huge
debt
burdens
crushing
down
upon
the
arch
and
spans
of
corporate
America
. . O

The
mounting
risks
did
not
go
unobserved
, , O
even
in
the
mid
. . O

But
there
were
enough
promoters
announcing
the
end
of
history
-LRB
in
this
case
suspension
of
normal
laws
of
economic
gravity
-RRB
for
society
to
continue
shielding
its
eyes
. . O

Mainstream
economists
and
commentators
, , O
craning
their
necks
up
at
the
great
pyramids
of
junk
financing
, , O
swiveling
their
heads
to
watch
the
avalanche
of
leveraged
buy
, , O
claimed
the
end
result
would
be
a
leaner
, , I
meaner
corporate
America
, , O
with
soaring
productivity
and
profits
and
the
weaker
gone
to
the
wall
. . O

But
this
is
not
where
the
rewards
of
junk
financing
were
found
. . O

The
beneficiaries
were
those
financiers
whose
icon
was
the
topic
figure
of
'80s
capitalism
, , O
Michael
Milken
's
$ $ B
517
million
salary
in
one
year
. . O

Left
economists
I
associate
with
-- : O
fellows
in
the
Union
of
Radical
Political
Economists
, , O
most
particularly
Robert
Pollin
of
the
economics
faculty
at
the
University
of
California
at
Riverside
-- : O
were
not
hypnotized
in
the
manner
of
their
pliant
colleagues
. . O

All
along
they
have
been
noting
the
tremors
and
pointing
out
the
underlying
realities
. . O

Profit
rates
after
the
great
merger
wave
are
no
higher
, , O
and
now
we
have
an
extremely
high
burden
relative
to
cash
flow
. . O

The
consequences
of
building
empires
with
sand
are
showing
up
. . O

In
contrast
to
previous
estimates
reckoning
the
default
rate
on
junk
bonds
at
2
% NN
or
3
% NN
, , O
a
Harvard
study
published
in
April
of
this
year
-LRB
and
discussed
in
a
lead
story
in
The
Wall
Street
Journal
for
Sept
18
-RRB
found
the
default
rate
on
these
junk
bonds
is
34
% NN
. . O

What
is
the
consequence
of
a
high
burden
, , O
high
default
rates
and
continued
low
profitability
? . O

Corporations
need
liquidity
, , O
in
the
form
of
borrowed
funds
. . O

Without
liquidity
from
the
junk
market
or
cash
flow
from
profits
, , O
they
look
to
the
government
, , O
which
obediently
assists
the
natural
motions
of
the
capitalist
economy
with
charity
in
the
form
of
cuts
in
the
capital
tax
rate
or
bailouts
. . O

The
consequence
can
be
inflation
, , O
brought
on
as
the
effect
of
a
desperate
bid
to
avoid
the
deflationary
shock
of
a
sudden
crash
. . O

Attacks
on
inflation
come
with
another
strategy
of
capital
of
a
very
traditional
sort
: : O
an
assault
on
wages
. . O

Mr
Fukuyama
, , O
peering
through
binoculars
at
the
end
of
history
, , O
said
in
his
essay
that
`` `` O
the
class
issue
has
actually
been
successfully
resolved
in
the
West
... : O

the
egalitarianism
of
modern
America
represents
the
essential
achievement
of
the
classless
society
envisioned
by
Marx
. . O
'' '' O

Mr
Fukuyama
might
want
to
consult
some
American
workers
on
the
subject
of
class
and
egalitarianism
. . O

From
its
peak
in
1972
of
$ $ B
198
, , O
the
average
American
weekly
wage
had
fallen
to
$ $ B
169
in
1987
-- : O
both
figures
being
expressed
in
1977
dollars
. . O

In
other
words
, , O
after
the
glory
boom
of
the
Reagan
years
, , O
wages
had
sunk
from
the
post
World
War
II
peak
by

he

The
decision

which
affects
millions

dollars

trading
positions

was
made
late
yesterday
because
the
Pacific
exchange
's
options
floor
was
shut
down

a
result

Tuesday

earthquake

The
SEC

squeeze

said
it
was
necessary
to
ensure
that
options
listed
on
the
exchange
could
be
traded
today
and
tomorrow
. . O

SEC
Chairman
Richard
Breeden
said
the
cooperation
by
the
exchanges
would
enable
investors
to
buy
and
sell
options
listed
solely
on
the
Pacific
exchange

guaranteeing
the
liquidity
of
the
market

Officials
at
the
four
exchanges
said
well
over
50
traders
from

Pacific

taking
flights
from

late
yesterday
to
the
American
, , I
New

exchanges
and
to
the
CBOE
, , O
where
they
would
continue
making
markets
in
the
Pacific
options

The
Big
Board
said
carpenters
quickly
erected
a
new
options
floor
to
accomodate
40
traders
from
the
Pacific
exchange
. . O

In
addition
, , O
specialists
on
the
exchanges
agreed
to
provide
backup
capital

in

options

exchanges

Trading
was
light
on
the
Pacific
Stock
Exchange
yesterday
, , O
with
workers
at
the
exchange
's
main
floor
in
San
Francisco
struggling
to
execute
orders
by
flashlight
as
a
result
of
a
continuing
power
outage
. . O

The
most
pressing
problem
was
the
suspension
of
options
trading
. . O

The
Pacific
exchange
has
options
for
129
underlying
stock
issues
, , O
including
highly
active
Hilton
Hotels
Corp
, , O
which
is
listed
on
the
Big
Board
. . O

Investors
were
concerned
that
they
might
be
unable
to
exercise
options
that
expire
tomorrow
. . O

But
professionals
said
throughout
the
day
that
the
shutdown
would
n
be
a
cause
for
alarm
even
if
it
were
to
persist
for
several
days
. . O

`` `` O
I
've
told
my
staff

clients
that
they
still
have
the
ability

exercise

are
guaranteed

Options
Clearing
Corp

said
Michael
Schwartz
, , O
a
senior
registered
options
strategist
at
Oppenheimer

Co
. . O

The
SEC
reassigned
trading
in
the
options
, , O
however
, , O
to
allow
investors
to
do
more
than
simply
exercise
the
options
. . O

While
the
exchange
's
equities
floor
in
San
Francisco
remained
open
on
a
limited
basis

orders
were
being
routed

It

said
Navin
Vyas

administrative
assistant
of
trading
floor
operations
of
the
exchange
, , O
which
has
daily
volume
of
about
10
million

Because
the
exchange

rerouting
orders
to
the
exchange

trading
operations
in
Los

`` `` O

Meanwhile

trying
to
cope

Charles
Daggs
, , O
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Sutro

said
traders
came
to
work
at
5
a
PDT
-- : O
many
on
foot
because
of
uncertain
road
and
traffic
conditions
-- : O
but
learned
that
they
would
have
to
await
a
required
inspection
by
the
city
in
order
to
turn
the
power
back
on
at
the
company
's
two
main
facilities
there
. . O

That
should
happen
by
today
, , O
he
said
. . O

Traders
worked
with
the
help
of
sunlight
streaming
through
windows
, , O
despite
large
cracks
in
the
walls
and
a
lack
of
incoming
phone
calls

Also
, , O
most
of
the
telecommunications
equipment
was
out

The
traders
were
executing
municipal
bond

mutual
fund

other
orders
through
a
sister
firm

Tucker
Anthony
Inc

which
is
also
owned

`` `` O

Mr

Sutro

Oakland
office
executed
orders
through
the
Sacramento

Others
, , O
like
Prudential
Securities

which
has
eight
offices
in
the
San

area

set
up
an

yesterday
morning
for
customers

obtain

commentary

At
Kidder
, , I
Peabody

branch
, , O
Manager
Janet
White
received
calls
yesterday
morning
from
workers
in
San

offered
to
work
in
Sacramento
. . O

Then
she
discovered
that
Quotron
Systems
Inc

Sacramento
lines
were
down
, , O
because
they
are
normally
tied
in
through
a
system
that
goes
through
San
Francisco

So
the
Kidder
brokers
had
to
call
other
company
offices

get
quotes
on
stocks

At
Quotron
, , O
the
company
's
National
Call
Center
, , O
which
swung
into
action
for
the
first
time
last
month

assembled
a
tactical
team
at
5
a
yesterday
to
begin
rerouting
lines
and
restore
service
to
brokers

The
company
dispatched
as
many

in
the
San

area
to
do
the
work
, , O
though
most

rerouting

Even

the

this

IBM

down

low
as
it
has
sunk
over
the
past
decade

The
announcement
came
after
the
market
's
close
. . O

The
move
by
IBM
was
n
exactly
a
surprise
. . O

The
company
has
spent
some
$ $ I
5
billion
over
the
past
3
1
years
to
buy
back
42
million
common
shares
, , O
or
roughly

outstanding

In
addition

despite
IBM
's
well
recent
problems

the
computer
giant
still
generates
enormous
amounts
of
cash

As

end
of
the
second
quarter

it
had
$ $ B
4
billion
of
cash

As
a
result
, , O
some
securities
analysts
had
predicted
in
recent
days
that
IBM
would
authorize
additional
purchases
. . O

In
Armonk
, , O
N
, , O
a
spokesman
said
that
although
IBM
did
n
view
its
spending
as
necessarily
a
way
to
support
the
stock

it
thought
the
purchases
were
a

improve

return
on
equity

`` `` O
We
view
it

'' '' O
the
spokesman
said

In
the
short
term

the
move
is
likely
to
have
little
effect
. . O

At
yesterday

closing
price

$ $ B
1

would
buy
back
about
10

or
less

outstanding

In

the

authorization

buy

repurchase
program

Over

long
term

however

IBM

repurchases

along

its
hefty
, , I
$ $ I
4
annual
dividend
and
generally
loyal
following
among
large
institutional
investors
-- : O
are
providing
a
floor
for
the
stock
price

Although
IBM
last
year
produced
its
first
strong
results
in
four
years
and
was
expected
to
continue
to
roll
this
year
, , O
it
began
faltering
as
early
as
January
. . O

First
, , O
it
had
trouble
manufacturing
a
chip
for
its
mainframes

IBM

bread
business

Then
it
had
a

including
problems
manufacturing
certain
personal
computers
and
the
delay
in
the
announcement
of
some
important
workstations

Finally

IBM
had
to
delay
the
introduction

which
account
for

For

Peter

Hart

whether
they

buy

For

devotion

quite
low

Brand

Only
23

quite
high

`` `` O

there
's
opportunity

create

strong

more

What

be
more

loyal

the
Journal

research
studies
indicate

Marketers
speculate
that
more
affluent

tend

lead
more
pressured
lives
and
do
n
have
time
to
research
the
products
they
buy
for
the
highest
quality
and
most
reasonable
price

An
established
brand
name
is
insurance
that
at

the
product
will
be
of
acceptable
quality
, , O
if
not
always
the
best
value

How

They

While
not
as
brand
loyal
as
in
the
past
, , O
consumers
today
do
n
buy
products
capriciously
, , O
either
. . O

Rather
, , O
they
tend
to
have
a
set
of
two
or
three
favorites

Sometimes
, , O
they
'll
choose
Ragu
spaghetti
sauce

other
times
, , O
it
will
be
Prego

Advertisers
attribute
this
shared
loyalty
to
the
striking
similarity
among
brands

If
a

absorbent
Pampers
hits
the
market

you
can
be
sure

The
BBDO
Worldwide
ad
agency
studied
`` `` O
brand
parity
'' '' O
and
found
that
consumers
believe
all
brands
are
about
the
same
in
a
number
of
categories
, , O
particularly
credit
cards
, , O
paper
towels
, , O
dry
soups
and
snack
chips
. . O

`` `` O
When
there
's
a
clutter
of
brands
, , O
consumers
simplify
the
complexity
by
telling
themselves
, , O
` `` O
All
brands
are
the
same
so
what
difference
does
it
make
which
I
buy
, , O
' '' O
'' '' O
says
Karen
Olshan
, , O
a
senior
vice
president
at
BBDO
. . O

`` `` O
Too
often
, , O
advertising
imagery
has
n
done
a
good
job
of
forging
a
special
emotional
bond
between
a
brand
and
the
consumer
. . O
'' '' O

But
given
such
strong
brand
disloyalty
, , O
some
marketers
are
putting
renewed
emphasis
on
image
advertising
. . O

A
small
but
growing
number
of
companies
are
also
trying
to
instill
more
fervent
brand
loyalty
through
such
personalized
direct
ploys
as
catalogs
, , O
magazines
and
membership
clubs
for
brand
users
. . O

While
discount
promotions
are
essential
for
most
brands
, , O
some
companies
concede
they
went
overboard
in
shifting
money
from
advertising
to
coupons
, , O
refunds
and
other
sales
incentives
. . O

Some
people
argue
that
strong
brands
can
afford
to
stop
advertising
for
a
time
because
of
the
residual
impact
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
spent
on
advertising
through
the
years
. . O

But
most
companies
are
too
afraid
to
take
that
chance
. . O

And
perhaps
with
good
reason
. . O

Says
Clayt
Wilhite
, , O
president
of
the
D
Masius
ad
agency
's
U
division
, , O
`` `` O
Every
time
24
hours
pass
without
any
advertising
reinforcement
, , O
brand
loyalty
will
diminish
ever
so
slightly
-- : O
even
for
a
powerful
brand
like
Budweiser

'' '' O

Consider
, , O
for
example
, , O
what
happened
to
Maxwell
House
coffee
. . O

The
Kraft
General
Foods
brand
stopped
advertising
for
about
a
year
in
1987
and
gave
up
several
market
share
points
and
its
leadership
position
in
the
coffee
business
. . O

But
since
returning
to
advertising
, , O
Maxwell
House
has
regained
the
lost
share
and
is
running
neck
and
neck
with
archrival
Folgers
. . O

`` `` O
Now
, , O
Philip
Morris
-LCB
Kraft
General
Foods
' POS
parent
company
-RCB
is
committed
to
the
coffee
business
and
to
increased
advertising
for
Maxwell
House
, , O
'' '' O
says
Dick
Mayer
, , O
president
of
the
General
Foods
USA
division
. . O

`` `` O
Even
though
brand
loyalty
is
rather
strong
for
coffee
, , O
we
need
advertising
to
maintain
and
strengthen
it

'' '' O

Campbell
Soup
Co
, , O
for
one
, , O
has
concluded
that
it
makes
good
sense
to
focus
more
on
its
most
loyal
customers
than
on
people
who
buy
competitive
brands
. . O

`` `` O
The
probability
of
converting
a
non
to
your
brand
is
about
three
in
1
, , O
'' '' O
says
Tony
Adams
, , O
the
company
's
vice
president
for
marketing
research
. . O

`` `` O
The
best
odds
are
with
your
core
franchise
. . O

Our
heavy
users
consume
two
to
three
cans
of
soup
a
week
, , O
and
we
'd
like
to
increase
that
. . O
'' '' O

So
Campbell
is
talking
to
its
`` `` I
brand
enthusiasts
, , O
'' '' O
probing
their
psychological
attachment
to
its
soup
. . O

In
one
consumer
focus
group

a
fan
declared
that
, , O
`` `` O
Campbell
's
soup
is
like
getting
a
hug
from
a
friend

'' '' O

That
helped
persuade

introduce
a
new
advertising
slogan
: : O
`` `` O
A
warm

Campbell

Insurers
face
the
prospect
of
paying
out
billions
of
dollars
for
damages
caused
by
this
week
's
California
earthquake
. . O

Getting
a
grip
on
the
extent
of
the
damages
is
proving
a
far
more
difficult
task
than
what
insurers
faced
after
Hurricane
Hugo
ripped
through
the
Caribbean
and
the
Carolinas
last
month
. . O

The
earthquake
's
toll
, , O
including
possible
deep
structural
damage
, , O
goes
far
beyond
the
more
easily
observed
damage
from
a
hurricane
, , O
says
George
Reider
, , O
a
vice
president
in
Aetna
Life
& CC
Casualty
Insurance
Co
's
claims
division
. . O

But
investors
are
betting
that
the
financial
and
psychological
impact
of
the
earthquake
, , O
coming
so
soon
after
the
hurricane
, , O
will
help
stem
more
than
two
years
of
intense
price
wars
among
business
insurers
. . O

Reflecting
that
logic
, , O
insurance
stocks
posted
strong
gains
. . O

Aetna
and
other
insurers
are
hiring
engineers
and
architects
to
help
them
assess
structural
damage
. . O

Most
insurers
already
have
mobilized
their
`` `` I
catastrophe
'' '' I
teams
to
begin
processing
claims
from
their
policyholders
in
northern
California
. . O

Since
commercial
air
travel
is
interrupted
, , O
Aetna
, , O
based
in
Hartford
, , O
Conn
, , O
chartered
three
planes
to
fly
claims
adjusters
into
Sacramento
and
then
planned
for
them
to
drive
to
the
Bay
area
. . O

About
25
adjusters
were
dispatched
yesterday
afternoon
, , O
along
with
laptop
computers
, , O
cellular
phones
and
blank
checks
. . O

Some
adjusters
, , O
already
in
other
parts
of
California
, , O
drove
to
the
disaster
area
with
recreational
vehicles
and
mobile
homes
that
could
be
used
as
makeshift
claims
centers

Insurers
will
be
advertising
800
numbers

probably
on
the
radio

that
policyholders
can
call
to
get
assistance

how

the
largest

be
somewhat
less

the
$ $ I
475

damages
it

pay
out

the

Earthquake
insurance

a
separate
policy
or
a
specific
endorsement
`` `` I
rider
'' '' O
on
a
homeowner
's
policy
in
California

because
of
the
area
's
vulnerability
to
earthquakes

State
Farm
said
about
25

of
its
policyholders
in
California
have
also
purchased
earthquake
insurance

Allstate
Insurance

San
Franciso
area

coverage

The
Association
of
California
Insurance
Companies
estimated
damage
to

property
could
total

500
million
, , O
but
only
$ $ I
100
million
to
$ $ I
150
million

insured

it
said

Officials
from
the
American
Insurance
Association

property
service
division

which
coordinates
the
efforts
of
the
claims
adjusters
in
an
area
after
a
natural
disaster
, , O
will
be
flying
to
San
Francisco
today
. . O

They
expect
to
have
a
preliminary
estimate
of
the
damages
in
a
day
or
two
. . O

Roads
and
bridges
in
the
Bay
area
appear
to
have
suffered
some
of
the
most
costly
damage
. . O

Highways
, , O
such
as
the
section
of
Interstate
880
that
collapsed
in
Oakland
, , O
generally
do
n
have
insurance
coverage
. . O

Industry
officials
say
the
Bay
Bridge
-- : O
unlike
some
bridges
-- : O
has
no
earthquake
coverage
, , O
either
, , O
so
the
cost
of
repairing
it
probably
would
have
to
be
paid
out
of
state
general
operating
funds
. . O

However
, , O
the
bridge
, , O
which
charges
a
$ $ I
1
toll
each
way
, , O
does
have
`` `` O
loss
of
income
'' '' B
insurance
to
replace
lost
revenue
if
the
operation
of
the
bridge
is
interrupted
for
more
than
seven
days
. . O

That
coverage
is
provided
by
a
syndicate
of
insurance
companies
including
Fireman
's
Fund
Corp
, , O
based
in
Novato
, , O
Calif
, , O
and
Cigna
Corp
, , O
based

Earthquake
claims
are
n
expected
to
cause
significant
financial
problems
for
the
insurance
industry
as
a
whole
. . O

Instead
, , O
even
with
the
liabilities
of
two
natural
disasters
in
recent
weeks
, , O
analysts
said
the
total
capital
of
the
industry
is
likely
to
be
higher
at
year
end
than
it
was
at
midyear
. . O

Indeed
, , O
the
earthquake
could
contribute
to
a
turnaround
in
the
insurance
cycle
in
a
couple
of
ways
. . O

For
example
, , O
insurers
may
seek
to
limit
their
future
exposure
to
catastrophes
by
increasing
the
amount
of
reinsurance
they
buy
. . O

Such
increased
demand
for
reinsurance
, , O
along
with
the
losses
the
reinsurers
will
bear
from
these
two
disasters
, , O
are
likely
to
spur
increases
in
reinsurance
prices
that
will
later
be
translated
into
an
overall
price
rise
. . O

Reinsurance
is
protection
taken
out
by
the
insurance
firms
themselves
. . O

`` `` O
We
are
saying
this
is
the
breaking
point
, , O
this
is
the
event
that
will
change
the
psychology
of

marketplace

'' '' O
said
William
Yankus
, , O
an
analyst
with
Conning
& CC
Co
, , O
a
Hartford
firm
that
specializes
in
the
insurance
industry

His
firm
, , O
along
with
some
others
, , O
issued
new
buy
recommendations
on
insurer
stocks
yesterday

Among

Still
, , O
a

could
be
devastated

`` `` O
I

hit

skids
on
this

'' '' O
said
Oppenheimer
& CC
Co
analyst
Myron
Picoult
. . O

He
suspects
some
insurers
who
had
purchased
reinsurance
to
limit
their
exposure
to
catastrophes
will
discover
that
reinsurance
was
used
up
by
Hurricane
Hugo
. . O

British
, , I
West
German
, , I
Scandinavian
and
other
overseas
insurers
are
bracing
for
big
claims
from
the
San
Francisco
earthquake
disaster

Although
it
's
unclear
how
much
exposure
the
London
market
will
face
, , O
U
underwriters
traditionally

a
large
reinsurance
exposure

catastrophe
coverage

Jack
Byrne

said
this

reinsurance
market

causing
these
rates
to
soar

The
catastrophe
losses
sustained
by
insurers
this
year
will
probably
be
the
worst
on
an
inflation
basis
since
1906

earthquake

San

Fire

Orin

destruction

Sir

`` `` O

do

Jaguar

`` `` O

by
offering
access

Besides
creating
joint
manufacturing
ventures

the

is
expected
to
give

Jaguar
figures
a
friendly
alliance

he
added

Sir

a
surprise
bid

The

publicly
held

know

Jaguar
supplier

agrees
`` `` O
we

Sir

GM

would
`` `` O

it
possible

An

`` `` O
You

Bob
Barber

an

A

with
GM
may
emerge
in

little
as
two
weeks

according
to
sources
close
to
the
talks

The
deal
would
require
approval
by
a
majority
of
Jaguar
shareholders
. . O

`` `` O
We
have
to
make
it
attractive
enough
that
-LCB
holders

accept
it

'' '' O
Sir

said

That
may
be
difficult
, , O
the
Jaguar
chairman
acknowledged
, , O
`` `` O
when
you
have
somebody
else
breathing
down
your
neck

'' '' O
Ford
probably
would
try
to
kill
the
proposal
by
enlisting
support
from
U
takeover
speculators

holding
out
the
carrot
of
a
larger
bid
later

said
Stephen
Reitman
, , O
European
auto
analyst

Phillips

Drew
. . O

Ford
ca
n
make
a

bid

government
restrictions

The
anti
measure
prevents
any

investor
from
buying
more
than
15
% NN
of
Jaguar
shares
without
permission
until
Dec
31
, , I
1990
. . O

But
with
its
10

stake
, , O
Ford
can
convene
a
special
Jaguar
shareholders
' POS
meeting
and
urge
them
to
drop
the
restrictions
prematurely
. . O

`` `` O
It
's
a
very
valuable
weapon
in

armory

'' '' O
which
could
enable
Ford
to
bid
sooner
for
Jaguar
, , O
observed
Mr
Barber
of
James
Capel

Otherwise

Jaguar
may
have
to
tolerate
the

giants

owning

more

`` `` O

BellSouth

factors

The

Journal
`` `` O
American

Survey

two
separate
, , I
door
nationwide
polls
conducted
for
the
Journal

Peter

Hart
Research
Associates

Organization
. . O

The
two
surveys
, , O
which
asked
different
questions
, , O
were
conducted
using
national
random
probability
samples
. . O

The
poll
conducted
by
Peter
D
Hart
Research
Associates
interviewed
2
adults
age
18
and
older
from
June
15
to
June
30
, , I
1989
. . O

The
poll
conducted
by
the
Roper
Organization
interviewed
2
adults
age
18
and
older
from
July
7
to
July
15
, , I
1989
. . O

Responses
were
weighted
on
the
basis
of
age
and
gender
to
conform
with
U
Census
data
. . O

For
each
poll
, , O
the
odds
are
19
out
of
20
that
if
pollsters
had
sought
to
survey
every
household
in
the
U
using
the
same
questionnaire
, , O
the
findings
would
differ
from
these
poll
results
by
no
more
than
2
1
percentage
points
in
either
direction

The
margin
of
error
for
subgroups
-- : O
for
example
, , O
married
women
with
children
at
home
-- : O
would
be
larger

In
addition
, , O
in
any
survey
, , O
there
is
always
the
chance
that
other
factors
such
as
question
wording
could
introduce
errors
into
the
findings
. . O

Program
traders
were
buying
and
selling
at
full
steam
Monday
, , O
the
first
trading
session
after
the
stock
market
's
190
plunge
Friday
. . O

They
accounted
for
a
hefty
16
% NN
of
New
York
Stock
Exchange
volume
Monday
, , O
the
fourth
busiest
session
ever
. . O

On
Friday
, , O
13
% NN
of
volume
was
in
computer
program
trades
. . O

In
August
, , O
by
contrast
, , O
program
trading
averaged
10
% NN
of
daily
Big
Board
turnover
. . O

Program
traders
were
publicly
castigated
following
the
508
crash
Oct
19
, , I
1987
, , O
and
a
number
of
brokerage
firms
pulled
back
from
using
this
strategy
for
a
while
. . O

But
as
the
outcry
faded
by
the
spring
of
1988
, , O
they
resumed
. . O

Some
observers
thought
that
after
Friday
's
sharp
drop
, , O
the
firms
would
rein
in
their
program
traders
to
avoid
stoking
more
controversy
. . O

But
the
statistics
released
yesterday
show
the
firms
did
nothing
of
the
sort
. . O

One
reason
, , O
they
said
, , O
was
that
the
official
reports
on
the
1987
crash
exonerated
program
trading
as
a
cause
. . O

Stock
arbitrage
is
the
most
controversial
form
of
program
trading
because
it
accelerates
market
moves
, , O
if
not
actually
causing
them
. . O

In
it
, , O
traders
buy
or
sell
stocks
and
offset
those
positions
in
stock
futures
contracts
to
profit
from
fleeting
price
discrepancies
. . O

Under
the
exchange
's
definitions
, , O
program
trading
also
describes
a
number
of
other
strategies
that
, , O
in
the
opinion
of
some
traders
, , O
do
n
cause
big
swings
in
the
market
. . O

The
Big
Board
's
disclosure
of
program
trading
activity
on
these
two
days
was
unusual
. . O

Though
it
collects
such
data
daily
, , O
its
monthly
reports
on
program
trading
usually
come
out
about
three
weeks
after
each
month
ends
. . O

The
September
figures
are
due
to
be
released
this
week
. . O

The
Big
Board
declined
to
name
the
Wall
Street
firms
involved
in
the
activity
Friday
and
Monday
, , O
or
the
type
of
strategies
used
. . O

But
traders
on
the
exchange
floor
, , O
who
can
observe
the
computer
trading
activity
on
monitor
screens
, , O
said
most
of
the
top
program
firms
were
active
both
days
. . O

Through
August
, , O
the
top
five
program
trading
firms
in
volume
were
Morgan
Stanley

Kidder

Peabody
& CC
Co
, , O
Merrill
Lynch
& CC
Co
, , O
PaineWebber
Group
Inc
and
Salomon
Brothers
Inc
. . O

Though
brokerage
officials
defended
their
use
of
program
trading
, , O
one
sign
of
what
an
issue
it
remains
was
that
few
executives
would
comment
on
the
record
. . O

Besides
reciting
the
pardon
for
program
trading
contained
in
the
Brady
Commission
report
, , O
they
said
stock
arbitrage
was
actually
needed
Monday
to
restore
the
markets
' POS
equilibrium
. . O

On
Friday
, , O
the
stock
futures
market
was
unhinged
from
the
stock
market
when
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
halted
trading
in

Poor

futures
contract

Futures
trading
resumed
a
half

the

shortly
thereafter

leaving
the
stock

By
Monday
morning
, , O
they
said

stock
arbitrage
sell
programs

the
link
between
stocks

But
stunning
volatility
was
produced
in
the
process

The

breathtaking
63

40
minutes

in

At
about

a

the
market
abruptly
turned
upward

`` `` O
I
can
just
tell
the
questions
are
right
back
where
they
were
: : O
` `` O
What
's
going
on
? . O

Where

Mr
Mason
says
he
's
convinced
the
public
still
wants
to
invest
in
common
stocks
, , O
even
though
they
believe
the
deck
is
stacked
against
them
. . O

But
`` `` O
these
wide
swings
scare
them
to
death
. . O
'' '' O

All
of
this
is
bad
news
for
the
big
brokerage
firms
such
as
Shearson
and
Merrill
Lynch
& CC
Co
that
have
big
`` `` I
retail
, , I
'' '' I
or
individual
, , I
businesses
. . O

After
expanding
rapidly
during
the
bull
years
up
to
the
1987
crash
, , O
retail
brokerage
operations
these
days
are
getting
barely
enough
business
to
pay
the
overhead
. . O

True
, , O
the
amount
of
money
investors
are
willing
to
entrust
to
their
brokers
has
been
growing
lately
. . O

But
those
dollars
have
been
going
into
such
`` `` I
safe
'' '' I
products
as
money
market
funds
, , O
which
do
n
generate
much
in
the
way
of
commissions
for
the
brokerage
firms
. . O

At
discount
brokerage
Charles
Schwab
& CC
Co
, , O
such
`` `` I
cash
'' '' I
investments
recently
accounted
for
a
record
$ $ I
8
billion
of
the
firm
's
$ $ I
25
billion
of
client
's
assets
. . O

The
brokers
' POS
hope
has
been
that
they
could
soon
coax
investors
into
shifting
some
of
their
hoard
into
the
stock
market
. . O

And
before
last
Friday
, , O
they
were
actually
making
modest
progress
. . O

A
slightly
higher
percentage
of
New
York
Stock
Exchange
volume
has
been
attributed
to
retail
investors
in
recent
months
compared
with
post
1988
, , O
according
to
Securities
Industry
Association
data
. . O

In
1987
, , O
an
average
19
% NN
of
Big
Board
volume
was
retail
business
, , O
with
the
monthly
level
never
more
than
21
% NN
. . O

The
retail
participation
dropped
to
an
average
18
% NN
in
1988
, , O
and
shriveled
to
barely
14
% NN
some
months
during
the
year
. . O

Yet
in
1989
, , O
retail
participation
has
been
more
than
20
% NN
in
every
month
, , O
and
was
23
% NN
in
August
, , O
the
latest
month
for
which
figures
are
available
. . O

Jeffrey
Schaefer
, , O
the
SIA
's
research
director
, , O
says
that
all
of
his
group
's
retail
statistics
could
be
overstated
by
as
much
as
five
percentage
points
because
corporate
buy
are
sometimes
inadvertently
included
in
Big
Board
data
. . O

But
there
did
seem
to
be
a
retail
activity
pickup
. . O

But
`` `` O
Friday
did
n
help
things
, , O
'' '' O
says
Mr
Schaefer
. . O

With
the
gyrations
of
recent
days
, , O
says
Hugo
Quackenbush
, , O
senior
vice
president
at
Charles
Schwab
, , O
many
small
investors
are
absolutely
convinced
that
`` `` O
they
should
n
play
in
the
stock
market
. . O
'' '' O

Joseph
Grano
, , O
president
of
retail
sales
and
marketing
at
PaineWebber
Group
Inc
, , O
still
thinks
that
individual
investors
will
eventually
go
back
into
the
stock
market
. . O

Investors
will
develop
`` `` O
thicker
skins
, , O
'' '' O
and
their
confidence
will
return
, , O
he
says
. . O

Friday
's
plunge
, , O
he
is
telling
PaineWebber
brokers
, , O
was
nothing
more
than
a
`` `` I
tremendous
reaction
to
leveraged
buy
stocks
. . O
'' '' O

Meanwhile
, , O
PaineWebber
remains
among
the
leaders
in
efforts
to
simply
persuade
investors
to
keep
giving
Wall
Street
their
money
. . O

`` `` O
It
's
more
of
an
important
issue
to
keep
control
of
those
assets
, , O
rather
than
push
the
investor
to
move
into
-LRB
specific
-RRB
products
such
as
equities
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Grano
says
. . O

`` `` O
The
equity
decision
will
come
when
the
client
is
ready
and
when
there
's
a
semblance
of
confidence
. . O
'' '' O

It
could
be
a
long
wait
, , O
say
some
industry
observers
. . O

`` `` O
Some
investors
will
tiptoe
back
in
, , O
'' '' O
says
Richard
Ross
, , O
a
market
research
director
for
Elrick
& CC
Lavidge
in
Chicago
. . O

`` `` O
Then
there
'll
be
another
swing
. . O

Given
enough
of
these
, , O
this
will
drive
everyone
out
except

most
hardy

he
adds

Mr
Ross
, , O
who
has
been

As
an
alternative
, , O
he
said
, , O
taxpayers
could
chose
to
reduce
their
gains
by
an
inflation
index
. . O

For
corporations
, , O
the
top
tax
rate
on
the
sale
of
assets
held
for
more
than
three
years
would
be
cut
to
33
% NN
from
the
current
top
rate
of
34
% NN
. . O

That
rate
would
gradually
decline
to
as
little
as
29
% NN
for
corporate
assets
held
for
15
years
. . O

The
Packwood
plan
would
also
include
a
proposal
, , O
designed
by
Sen
William
Roth
-LRB
R
, , O
Del
-RRB
, , O
that
would
expand
and
alter
the
deduction
for
individual
retirement
accounts
. . O

The
Roth
plan
would
create
a
new
, , I
non
IRA
from
which
money
could
be
withdrawn
tax
not
only
for
retirement
, , O
but
also
for
the
purchase
of
a
first
home
and
to
pay
education
and
medical
expenses
. . O

Current
IRAs
could
be
rolled
over
into
the
new
IRAs
but
would
be
subject
to
tax
. . O

For
their
part
, , O
the
group
of
Democrats
are
working
on
a
plan
that
, , O
like
the
Packwood
proposal
, , O
would
grant
larger
exclusions
to
assets
the
longer
they
were
held
by
individuals
and
companies
. . O

Newly
acquired
assets
would
get
a
bigger
break
than
those
currently
held
. . O

An
extra
exclusion
would
be
given
to
long
stock
in
small
and
medium
corporations
just
starting
up
. . O

No
one
in
the
Senate
is
considering
the
capital
plan
passed
by
the
House
. . O

That
plan
would
provide
a
30
% NN
exclusion
to
assets
sold
over
a
2
1
period
ending
Dec
31
, , I
1991
. . O

After
then
, , O
the
House
measure
would
boost
the
tax
rate
to
28
% NN
and
exclude
from
tax
the
gain
attributable
to
inflation
. . O

Senators
are
focusing
on
making
a
capital
differential
permanent
. . O

Separately
, , O
Chairman
Dan
Rostenkowski
-LRB
D
, , O
Ill
. . O
-RRB
of
the
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
said
he
did
n
want
the
capital
tax
cut
or
any
other
amendments
attached
to
the
pending
bill
raising
the
federal
borrowing
limit
. . O

The
current
debt
limit
expires
Oct
31
. . O

He
also
urged
House
and
Senate
negotiators
to
rid
the
deficit
bill
of
all
provisions
that
increase
the
budget
deficit
, , O
including
the
House
capital
provision

From
a
helicopter
a
thousand
feet
above
Oakland
after
the
second
earthquake
in
U
history
, , O
a
scene
of
devastation
emerges
: : O
a
freeway
crumbled
into
a
concrete
sandwich
, , O
hoses
pumping
water
into
once
apartments
, , O
abandoned
autos
. . O

But
this
quake
was
n
the
big
one
, , O
the
replay
of
1906
that
has
been
feared
for
so
many
years
. . O

Despite
the
tragic
loss
of
more
than
270
lives
, , O
and
damage
estimated
in
the
billions
, , O
most
businesses
and
their
plants
and
offices
in
the
Bay
area
were
n
greatly
affected
. . O

The
economic
life
of
the
region
is
expected
to
revive
in
a
day
or
two
, , O
although
some
transportation
problems
may
last
weeks
or
months
. . O

A
main
factor
mitigating
more
widespread
damage
was
the
location
of
the
quake
's
epicenter
-- : O
20
miles
from
the
heart
of
the
Silicon
Valley
and
more
than
50
miles
from
downtown
San
Francisco
and
Oakland
. . O

Also
, , O
the
region
's
insistence
on
strict
building
codes
helped
prevent
wider
damage
. . O

The
tremendous
energy
of
the
quake
was
dissipated
by
the
distance
, , O
so
that
most
parts
of
the
valley
and
the
major
cities
suffered
largely
cosmetic
damage
-- : O
broken
windows
, , O
falling
brick
and
cornices
, , O
buckled
asphalt
or
sidewalks
. . O

Of
course
, , O
the
quake
was
the
worst
since
the
emergence
of
the
computer
era
turned
Silicon
Valley
into
the
nation
's
capital
of
high
technology
. . O

Like
other
major
American
cities
, , O
the
San
Francisco
-- : I
Oakland
area
owes
its
current
prosperity
more
to
its
infrastructure
of
fiber
cables
linking
thousands
of
computer
terminals
and
telephones
than
to
its
location
astride
one
of
the
world
's
great
natural
harbors
. . O

When
the
tremors
struck
, , O
the
region
's
largely
unseen
high
fabric
held
up
surprisingly
well
despite
the
devastation
visible
from
the
air
. . O

Michael
L
Bandler
, , O
vice
president
for
network
technology
at
Pacific
Bell
Telephone
Co
, , O
says
nearly
all
the
network
's
computer
switches
, , O
which
move
thousands
of
calls
a
minute
from
one
location
to
another
, , O
changed
to
battery
power
when
the
city
lost
power
. . O

The
battery
packs
have
enough
power
for
only
three
hours
, , O
but
that
gave
emergency
crews
time
to
turn
on
an
emergency
system
that
runs
primarily
on
diesel
fuel
. . O

Of
some
160
switches
in
Pacific
Bell
's
network
, , O
only
four
went
down
. . O

One
of
those
was
in
Hollister
, , O
Calif
, , O
near
the
earthquake
's
epicenter
. . O

Few
telephone
lines
snapped
. . O

That
's
because
the
widely
used
fiber
cable
has
been
installed
underground
with
25
extra
feet
of
cable
between
junction
points
. . O

The
slack
absorbs
the
pulling
strain
generated
by
an
earthquake
. . O

Nevertheless
, , O
phone
service
was
sporadic
; : O
many
computer
terminals
remained
dark
, , O
and
by
late
yesterday
a
third
of
San
Francisco
remained
without
power
. . O

Business
in
the
nation
's
fourth
metropolitan
region
was
nearly
paralyzed
; : O
an
estimated
one
million
members
of
the
work
force
stayed
at
home
. . O

The
economic
dislocation
was
as
abrupt
as
the
earthquake
itself
, , O
as
virtually
all
businesses
shut
down
. . O

The
$ $ I
125
Bay
area
economy
represents
one
of
the
economy
of
the
nation
's
most
populous
state
and
accounts
for
2
% NN
to
3
% NN
of
the
nation
's
total
output
of
goods
and
services
, , O
according
to
the
Center
for
Continuing
Study
of
the
California
Economy
in
Palo
Alto
. . O

In
high
, , O
the
Bay
area
accounts
for
15
% NN
to
20
% NN
of
the
U
computer
industry

`` `` O
This
has
been
a
major
disruption
for

economy

'' '' O
says
Pauline
Sweezey

the

`` `` O
Obviously

'' '' O

The
damage
to
the
Bay
area
's
roadways
could
cause
significant
economic
hardship
. . O

A
quarter
of
a
million
people
cross
the
Bay
Bridge
every
day
, , O
far
more
than
the
100
that
use
the
Bay
Area
Rapid

which
was
working
but

city
's
Financial
District
yesterday
afternoon
because
electricity
was
shut
off
and
the
area
was
being
checked
for
gas
leaks
. . O

California
state
transportation
officials
interviewed
by
telephone
say
they
nevertheless
do
n
expect
serious
problems
for
commerce
in
and
out
of
the
Bay
area
. . O

All
major
roadways
except
Interstate
880
, , O
known
as
the
Nimitz
Freeway
, , O
and
the
Bay
Bridge
were
open
by
1
p
yesterday
. . O

Officials
expect
difficulty
routing
traffic
through
downtown
San
Francisco
. . O

The
earthquake
caused
many
streets
to
buckle
and
crack
, , O
making
them
impassible
. . O

Other
roads
were
obstructed
by
collapsed
buildings
and
damaged
water
and
power
lines
, , O
an
emergency
relief
spokesman
says
. . O

San
Francisco
Mayor
Art
Agnos
estimated
the
damage
to
his
city
alone
at
$ $ B
2
billion
. . O

But
many
predicted
that
the
commercial
disruption
would
be
short
. . O

Of
the
scores
of
companies
contacted
by
this
newspaper
, , O
few
reported
any
damage
that
they
did
n
expect
to
have
remedied
within
a
day
or
two
. . O

It
is
possible
, , O
of
course
, , O
that
some
of
the
most
seriously
damaged
companies
could
n
be
reached
, , O
particularly
in
areas
nearest
the
epicenter
. . O

Typical
, , O
perhaps
, , O
was
the
situation
at
New
United
Motor
Manufacturing
Inc
, , O
the
General
Motors
Corp
joint
auto
plant
in
Fremont
, , O
about
35
miles
south
of
Oakland

Ten
of
the
plant
's
workers
were
injured
when
the
quake
hit
about
a
half
into
the
afternoon
shift

seven

Metal
racks

a

The

But
the

was
able
to
resume
limited
production
of
its
Toyota
Corollas

Geo

by

a

and

Computer

At

Vice

yesterday
afternoon

` `` O
When
the

handled
smoothly
Tuesday

`` `` O
The

A
disaster
plan
in
which
the
Los

needed
, , O
he
adds
. . O

Most
of
the
telephone
problems
in
the
immediate
aftermath
stemmed
from
congestion
. . O

The
telephone
network
simply
could
n
handle
the
large
number
of
people
seeking
to
make
a
call
at
the
same
time
. . O

The
volume
resulted
in
dial
delays
that
were
as
short
as
15
seconds
and
as
long
as
five
minutes
. . O

Mr
Bandler
puts
traffic
volume
at
10

The

block
traffic
much
as

William

says
its
Pacific
Bell
unit
also
was
blocking
about
50

its

Ironically
, , O
the
long
effect

the
earthquake
may
be
to
bolster
the
Bay
area
's
economic
fortunes
and
, , O
indeed

the

product

also
lead
to
new
safeguards

`` `` O
It

Wall

reacted
swiftly
yesterday
to

Shares
of
Lone

Lone

spokesman

London
says

`` `` O
Obviously

any

It

something
likely

There

'' '' O

Lone
Star
's
San

facilities

damaged

the
quake

The
earthquake
is
likely
to
reduce
GNP
negligibly
in
the
near
term
and
then
could
raise
it
a
bit
as
rebuilding
begins
. . O

The
first
effects
are
, , O
of
course
, , O
negative
as
work
is
disrupted
and
people
lose
income

cut
spending

Corporate

also
dip

Many
of

lost
tourism
dollars

be
offset

`` `` O

`` `` O

Mr

He
cautions
that

estimates

often
low

the

The

Mr

Experts
caution
that
it
is
far
too
soon
for
reliable
estimates
of
the
quake

total
damage

it

clear
that

But
the
man

East
Germany
yesterday
removed
Erich
Honecker
, , O
one
of
the
staunchest
holdouts
against
the
reform
rumbling
through
the
Communist
world
, , O
in
an
effort
to
win
back
the
confidence
of
its
increasingly
rebellious
citizens
. . O

But
while
it
was
a
move
that
stunned
the
East
bloc
, , O
it
hardly
ushers
in
an
era
of
reform
-- : O
at
least
anytime
soon
. . O

For
the
Politburo
replaced
Mr
Honecker
, , O
who
had
led
East
Germany
for
18
years
and
before
that
headed
its
security
apparatus
, , O
with
a
man
cut
of
the
same
cloth
: : O
Egon
Krenz
, , O
the
most
recent
internal
chief
and
a
longtime
Honecker
protege
. . O

East
Germany
, , O
it
is
clear
, , O
is
no
Poland
, , O
where
the
Communist
Party
now
shares
power
with
the
democratically
elected
Solidarity
union
. . O

Nor
is
it
a
Hungary
, , O
where
yesterday
the
parliament
approved
constitutional
changes
meant
to
help
turn
the
Communist
nation
into
a
multiparty
democracy
. . O

Still
, , O
any
change
in
East
Germany
has
enormous
implications
, , O
for
both
East
and
West
. . O

It
raises
the
long
hopes
of
many
Germans
for
reunification
-- : O
a
prospect
that
almost
equally
alarms
political
leaders
in
Moscow
, , O
Washington
and
Western
Europe
. . O

Mr
Krenz
, , O
52
, , O
was
named
the
new
party
chief
just
minutes
after
the
Party
's
163
Central
Committee
convened
in
East
Berlin
. . O

Although
the
East
German
news
agency
ADN
claimed
Mr
Honecker
had
asked
to
be
relieved
of
his
duties
for
`` `` O
health
reasons
, , O
'' '' O
West
German
government
sources
said
the
26
Politburo
had
asked
for
his
resignation
at
a
separate
meeting
late
Tuesday
. . O

-LRB
Mr
Honecker
was
twice
hospitalized
this
summer
for
a
gall
bladder
ailment
and
his
physical
condition
has
been
the
subject
of
intense
speculation
in
the
Western
media
. . O
-RRB

ADN
said
Mr
Honecker
, , O
a
hard
Stalinist
who
in
1961
supervised
the
construction
of
the
Berlin
Wall
, , O
also
was
relieved
of
his
title
as
head
of
state
and
his
position
as
chief
of
the
military
. . O

Mr
Krenz
is
expected
to
be
formally
named
to
all
three
positions
once
the
nation
's
parliament
convenes
later
this
week
. . O

Mr
Honecker
's
ignoble
fall
culminates
nearly
two
decades
of
iron
leadership
during
which
Mr
Honecker
, , O
now
77
years
old
, , O
built
East
Germany
into
the
most
economically
advanced
nation
in
the
Soviet
bloc
. . O

His
grip
on
power
unraveled
this
summer
as
thousands
of
his
countrymen
, , O
dissatisfied
by
the
harshness
of
his
rule
, , O
fled
to
the
West
. . O

Thousands
more
have
taken
to
the
streets
in
the
last
month
in
East
Germany
's
largest
wave
of
domestic
unrest
since
a
workers
' POS
uprising
in
1953
. . O

In
Washington
, , O
the
Bush
administration
took
a
characteristically
cautious
and
skeptical
view
of
the
leadership
change
. . O

The
official
line
was
to
offer
warmer
ties
to
Mr
Krenz
, , O
provided
he
is
willing
to
institute
reforms
. . O

But
U
officials
have
strong
doubts
that
he
is
a
reformer
. . O

President
Bush
told
reporters
: : O
`` `` O
Whether
that
-LCB
the
leadership
change
-RCB
reflects
a
change
in
East
relations
, , O
I
do
n
think
so
. . O

Because
Mr
Krenz
has
been
very
much
in
accord
with
the
policies
of
Honecker
. . O
'' '' O

One
top
U
expert
on
East
Germany
added
: : O
`` `` O
There
is
no
clear
champion
of
reform
, , O
that
we
know
of
, , O
in
the
East
German
leadership
. . O
'' '' O

Indeed
, , O
Mr
Krenz
said
on
East
German
television
last
night
that
there
will
be
no
sharing
of
power
with
pro
groups
. . O

He
said
, , O
while
dialogue
is
important
, , O
enough
forums
already
exist
`` `` O
in
which
different
interests
'' '' O
can
express
themselves
. . O

The
removal
of
Mr
Honecker
was
apparently
the
result
of
bitter
infighting
within
the
top
ranks
of
the
Communist
party
. . O

According
to
West
German
government
sources
, , O
Mr
Honecker
and
several
senior
Politburo
members
fought
over
the
last
week
to
delay
any
decisions
about
a
leadership
change
. . O

But
, , O
with
public
demonstrations
in
the
country
growing
in
size
and
intensity
, , O
Mr
Honecker
and
several
key
allies
lost
out
in
this
battle
, , O
officials
say
. . O

Those
allies
included
Politburo
members
Guenter
Mittag
, , O
who
has
long
headed
economic
affairs
, , B
and
Joachim
Hermann
, , O
chief
of
information
policy
. . O

Both
men
were
also
relieved
of
their
duties
yesterday
. . O

Although
other
resignations
may
follow
, , O
it
's
still
not
clear
to
what
extent
the
change
in
party
personnel
will
alter
the
government
's
resistance
to
fundamental
change
. . O

Clearly
, , O
the
central
figure
in
this
process
is
Egon
Krenz
. . O

Born
in
1937
in
a
Baltic
Sea
town
now
part
of
Poland
, , O
he
was
eight
years
old
when
World
War
II
ended
. . O

Like
West
German
Chancellor
Helmut
Kohl
, , O
he
represents
the
postwar
generation
that
has
grown
up
during
Germany
's
division
. . O

Since
joining
the
Politburo
in
1983
as
its
youngest
member
, , O
Mr
Krenz
had
acquired
the
nickname
`` `` O
crown
prince
, , O
'' '' O
a
reference
to
the
widely
held
view
that
he
was
the
hand
successor
to
Mr
Honecker
. . O

In
fact
, , O
the
two
men
have
had
strikingly
similar
career
paths
, , O
both
having
served
as
chief
of
internal
security
before
their
rise
to
the
top
party
position
. . O

Moreover
, , O
both
men
have
hewn
to
a
similar
hard
philosophy
. . O

Notably
, , O
one
of
Mr
Krenz
's
few
official
visits
overseas
came
a
few
months
ago
, , O
when
he
visited
China
after
the
massacre
in
Beijing
. . O

He
later
defended
the
Chinese
government
's
response
during
a
separate
visit
to
West
Germany
. . O

East
German
Protestantism
in
particular
fears
Mr
Krenz
, , O
in
part
because
of
an
incident
in
January
1988
when
he
was
believed
to
have
ordered
the
arrest
of
hundreds
of
dissidents
who
had
sought
refuge
in
the
Church
. . O

However
, , O
Mr
Krenz
also
has
a
reputation
for
being
politically
savvy
. . O

His
shrewd
ability
to
read
the
shifting
popular
mood
in
East
Germany
is
best
illustrated
by
his
apparent
break
with
his
old
mentor
, , O
Mr
Honecker
. . O

Indeed
, , O
according
to
West
German
government
sources
, , O
he
was
one
of
the
leaders
in
the
power
struggle
that
toppled
Mr
Honecker
. . O

In
recent
days
, , O
Mr
Krenz
has
sought
to
project
a
kinder
image
. . O

According
to
a
report
widely
circulating
in
East
Berlin
, , O
it
was
Mr
Krenz
who
ordered
police
to
stop
using
excessive
force
against
demonstrators
in
Leipzig
. . O

`` `` O
He
does
n
want
to
have
the
image
of
the
gun
man
, , O
'' '' O
says
Fred
Oldenburg
, , O
an
expert
at
the
Bonn
Institute
of
East
European
and
International
Studies
in
Cologne
. . O

`` `` O
He
's
not
a
reformer
-- : O
he
wants
to
have
the
image
of
a
reformer
. . O
'' '' O

As
part
of
his
image
polishing
, , O
Mr
Krenz
is
expected
to
take
modest
steps
toward
reform
to
rebuild
confidence
among
the
people
and
reassert
the
party
's
authority
. . O

Besides
sacking
other
senior
Politburo
officials
who
allied
themselves
with
Mr
Honecker
, , O
Mr
Krenz
could
loosen
controls
on
the
news
media
, , O
free
up
travel
restrictions
, , O
and
establish
a
dialogue
with
various
dissident
groups
. . O

But
will
it
be
enough
? . O

West
German
government
officials
and
Western
analysts
are
doubtful
. . O

`` `` O
He
does
n
signify
what
people
want
, , O
so
the
unrest
will
go
on
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Oldenburg
predicts
. . O

At
the
same
time
, , O
the
expectations
of
the
East
German
people
are
great
and
will
continue
to
grow
. . O

Says
one
West
German
official
: : O
`` `` O
What
's
necessary
now
is
the
process
of
democratization
. . O

Not
just
that
people
are
being
heard
but
that
their
interests
are
being
taken
seriously
. . O
'' '' O

Chancellor
Kohl
, , O
meanwhile
, , O
has
invited
Mr
Krenz
to
open
discussions
with
Bonn
on
a
wide
range
of
subjects
. . O

Reports
in
the
West
German
press
, , O
citing
sources
in
East
Germany
, , O
suggest
Mr
Krenz
may
serve
only
as
a
bridge
between
Mr
Honecker
and
a
genuine
reform
leader
. . O

Adding
to
that
speculation
is
Mr
Krenz
's
reputation
as
a
heavy
drinker
, , O
who
is
said
to
also
suffer
from
diabetes
. . O

`` `` O
This
is
a
dynamic
process
and
we
're
experiencing
the
first
step
, , O
'' '' O
the
Bonn
official
adds
. . O

The
selection
of
Mr
Krenz
may
also
disappoint
Moscow
. . O

Soviet
leader
Mikhail
Gorbachev
has
pressed
hard
for
a
change
in
East
Germany
's
rigid
stance
. . O

Two
reform
party
leaders
favored
by
Moscow
as
possible
successors
to
Mr
Honecker
, , O
Dresden
party
secretary
Hans
Modrow
and
Politburo
member
Guenter
Schabowski
, , O
were
passed
over
. . O

If
Mr
Krenz
sticks
to
rigid
policies
the
pressure
from
the
Soviet
Union
could
intensify
. . O

In
Moscow
, , O
Mr
Gorbachev
sent
Mr
Krenz
a
congratulatory
telegram
that
appeared
to
urge
the
new
leadership
to
heed
growing
calls
for
change
. . O

According
to
the
Soviet
news
agency
Tass
, , O
`` `` O
Gorbachev
expressed
the
conviction
that
the
leadership
of
the
Socialist
Unity
Party
of
-LCB
East
-RCB
Germany

sensitive
to
the
demands

time

... : O

find
solutions
to
complicated
problems

German
Democratic
Republic
-RCB
encountered
. . O
'' '' O

A
force
of
younger
pro
members
in
the
East
German
bureaucracy
has
for
some
time
been
pushing
for
relaxation
within
their
country
. . O

The
older
generation
has
been
torn
between
a
fear
of
tampering
with
the
status
quo
and
a
fear
of
what
might
happen
if
they
did
n
. . O

From
the
perspective
of
East
Germany
's
old
guard
, , O
reforms
that
smack
of
capitalism
and
Western
democracy
could
eliminate
their
country
's
reason
for
being
. . O

Unlike
the
other
nations
of
the
bloc
, , O
East
Germany
is
a
creature
of
the
Cold
War
. . O

Erasing
the
differences
still
dividing
Europe
, , O
and
the
vast
international
reordering
that
implies
, , O
wo
n
endanger
the
statehood
of
a
Poland
or
a
Hungary
. . O

But
it
could
ultimately
lead
to
German
reunification
and
the
disappearance
of
East
Germany
from
the
map
. . O

Which
is
what
the
Old
Guard
fears
. . O

`` `` O
I
'm
sure
they
'll
formulate
a
reform
that
will
be
a
recipe
for
the
GDR
's
future
as
a
separately
identifiable
state
, , O
'' '' O
says
Michael
Simmons
, , O
a
British
journalist
whose
book
on
East
Germany
, , O
entitled
`` `` O
The
Unloved
Country
, , O
'' '' O
was
published
this
month
. . O

Up
to
now
, , O
that
recipe
has
consisted
of
a
dogged
effort
by
former
leader
Walter
Ulbricht
to
establish
the
country
's
international
legitimacy
, , O
followed
by
Mr
Honecker
's
campaign
to
build
the
East
bloc
's
only
successful
Stalinist
economy
into
a
consumer
paradise
. . O

Neither
man
achieved
perfection
. . O

Early
in
1987
, , O
Mr
Honecker
and
his
team
stopped
paying
thin
compliments
to
Mr
Gorbachev
and
joined
with
Romania
in
rejecting
any
necessity
for
adjustments
in
their
systems
. . O

The
less
Czechoslovaks
and
Bulgarians
, , O
in
contrast
, , O
declared
their
intentions
to
reform
, , O
while
doing
nothing
concrete
about
it
. . O

The
East
German
media
soon
began
presenting
Mr
Gorbachev
's
speeches
only
as
sketchy
summaries
, , O
and
giving
space
to
his
opponents
. . O

By
late
1988
, , O
they
were
banning
Soviet
publications
. . O

The
country
abandoned
its
former
devotion
to
socialist
unity
and
took
to
insisting
instead
that
each
country
in
the
bloc
ought
to
travel
its
own
road
. . O

Mr
Honecker
spoke
of
`` `` O
generally
valid
objective
laws
of
socialism
'' '' O
and
left
no
room
for
debate
. . O

With
this
year
's
dislocations
in
China
and
the
Soviet
Union
, , O
and
the
drive
to
democracy
in
Poland
and
Hungary
, , O
the
East
German
leadership
grew
still
more
defensive
. . O

Politburo
member
Joachim
Herrman
confessed
to
a
`` `` I
grave
concern
'' '' O
over
Hungarian
democracy
. . O

`` `` O
Under
the
banner
that
proclaims
the
` `` I
renewal
of
socialism
, , O
' '' O
'' '' O
he
said
, , O
`` `` O
forces
are
at
work
that
are
striving
to
eliminate
socialism
. . O
'' '' O

Some
loyal
voices
, , O
in
and
out
of
the
East
German
Communist
party
, , O
saw
the
nation
's
unrest
coming
. . O

The
first
signs
were
economic
. . O

Despite
heavily
subsidized
consumer
industries
, , O
East
Germans
have
for
years
watched
the
West
pull
farther
out
ahead
. . O

In
1988
, , O
for
the
first
time
, , O
economic
growth
came
to
a
dead
stop
. . O

Gingerly
, , O
some
economists
began
to
blame
central
planning
. . O

Some
writers
in
theoretical
journals
even
raised
the
notion
of
introducing
democracy
, , O
at
least
in
the
workplace
. . O

By
summer
, , O
an
independent
reform
movement
was
saying
out
loud
what
it
had
only
whispered
before
. . O

But
they
are
stalwart
socialists
. . O

Their
proclaimed
purpose
is
to
cleanse
East
Germany
of
its
Stalinist
muck
, , O
not
to
merge
with
the
West
. . O

One
of
their
pastors
has
envisioned
a
`` `` I
new
utopia
'' '' O
of
`` `` O
creative
socialism

'' '' O

Meanwhile
, , O
the
man
Mr
Krenz
replaces
has
left
an
indelible
mark
on
East
German
society
. . O

Imprisoned
by
the
Nazis
during
World
War
II
for
his
political
beliefs
, , O
Mr
Honecker
typified
the
postwar
generation
of
committed
Communist
leaders
in
Eastern
Europe
who
took
their
cues
from
Moscow
. . O

He
was
a
`` `` I
socialist
warrior
'' '' O
who
felt
rankled
by
West
Germany
's
enormous
postwar
prosperity
and
the
Bonn
government
's
steadfast
refusal
to
recognize
the

Because

company
officials
could

immediately
be

comment

A
spokesman
for

said
the
12
limited
partnerships
, , O
which
were
marketed
by
brokerage
firms
and
financial
planners
between
1979
and
1984

raised

hundred
million
dollars
from
investors

With
airline
deals
in
a
tailspin
, , O
legendary
Wall
Street
trader
Michael
Steinhardt
could
have
trouble
parachuting
out
of
USAir
Group
, , O
traders
say
. . O

Only
a
week
ago
, , O
when
airline
buy
fever
was
already
winding
down
, , O
Mr
Steinhardt
was
engaged
in
a
duel
with
USAir
. . O

He
was
threatening
to
take
over
the
carrier
, , O
after
spending
an
estimated
$ $ I
167
million
to
build
an
8
% NN
USAir
stake
for
his
investment
clients
. . O

The
would
raider
even
hired
an
investment
banker
to
give
teeth
to
his
takeover
threat
, , O
which
was
widely
interpreted
as
an
effort
to
flush
out
an
acquirer
for
USAir
, , B
or
for
his
own
stake
. . O

In
fighting
USAir
, , O
Mr
Steinhardt
was
pitted
against
another
investor
, , O
billionnaire
Warren
Buffett
, , O
who
bought
into
USAir
to
help
fend
off
Mr
Steinhardt
. . O

Mr
Buffett
's
firm
, , O
Berkshire
Hathaway
, , O
holds
a
much
bigger
stake
in
the
carrier
than
Mr
Steinhardt
's
firm
, , O
Steinhardt
Partners
. . O

Now
, , O
in
the
wake
of
UAL
's
troubles
in
financing
its
buy
, , O
the
airline
raiding
game
has
been
grounded
. . O

Instead
of
hoping
to
sell
his
USAir
stake
at
analysts
' POS
estimated
buy
price
of
$ $ B
80
a
share
, , O
Mr
Steinhardt
is
stuck
with
roughly
3
million
USAir
shares
that
cost
him
$ $ B
45
, , O
on
average
, , O
but
yesterday
closed
at
40
1
, , O
up
1
, , O
in
New

Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
. . O

`` `` O
It
does
n
make
sense
to
parachute
out
at
this
price
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Steinhardt
says
, , O
though
he
has
stopped
his
takeover
talk
and
now
commends
USAir
managers
' POS
`` `` I
operating
skills
. . O
'' '' O

At
the
current
price
, , O
the
USAir
holding
represents
9
% NN
of
all
the
assets
that
Mr
Steinhardt
manages
. . O

A
week
ago
, , O
USAir
stock
briefly
soared
above
52
after
a
report
in
USA
Today
that
Mr
Steinhardt
might
launch
a
hostile
bid
for
the
carrier
, , O
though
takeover
speculators
say
they
were
skeptical
. . O

`` `` O
If
USAir
is
worth
80
as
a
takeover
and
the
stock
went
to
52
, , O
the
market
was
saying
Steinhardt
's
presence
was
n
worth
anything
, , O
in
terms
of
getting
a
deal
done
, , O
'' '' O
says
a
veteran
takeover
speculator
. . O

Traders
say
this
all
goes
to
show
that
even
the
smartest
money
manager
can
get
infected
with
crowd
passions
. . O

In
trying
to
raid
USAir
, , O
Mr
Steinhardt
abandoned
his
usual
role
as
a
passive
investor
, , O
and
ran
into
snags
. . O

Moreover
, , O
unlike
Mr
Buffett
, , O
who
often
holds
big
stakes
in
companies
for
years
, , O
Mr
Steinhardt
has
n
in
the
past
done
much
long
investing
. . O

Mr
Steinhardt
, , O
who
runs
about
$ $ I
1
billion
for
Steinhardt
Partners
, , O
made
his
name
as
a
gunslinging
trader
, , O
moving
in
and
out
of
stocks
with
agility
-- : O
enriching
himself
and
his
investment
clients
. . O

Meanwhile
, , O
his
big
losses
, , O
for
instance
in
1987
's
crash
, , O
generally
have
been
trading
losses
. . O

So
, , O
some
see
a
special
irony
in
the
fact
that
Mr
Steinhardt
, , O
the
trader
, , O
now
is
encumbered
with
a
massive
, , I
illiquid
airline
holding
. . O

Analysts
say
USAir
stock
might
lose
four
or
five
points
if
the
Steinhardt
stake
was
dumped
all
at
once
. . O

As
a
result
, , O
Mr
Steinhardt
must
reconcile
himself
to
selling
USAir
at
a
loss
, , B
or
to
holding
the
shares
as
an
old
investment
. . O

`` `` O
Long
investing
-- : O
that
's
not
Steinhardt
's
style
, , O
'' '' O
chuckles
an
investor
who
once
worked
at
Steinhardt
Partners
. . O

`` `` O
He
does
n
usually
risk
that
much
unless
he
thinks
he
has
an
ace
in
the
hole
, , O
'' '' O
adds
another
Steinhardt
Partners
alumnus
. . O

In
recent
days
, , O
traders
say
USAir
has
been
buying
its
own
shares
, , O
as
part
of
a
program
to
retire
about
eight
million
USAir
shares
, , O
though
the
carrier
wo
n
discuss
its
buy
program
. . O

If
USAir
stepped
up
its
share
purchases
, , O
that
might
be
a
way
for
Mr
Steinhardt
to
get
out
, , O
says
Timothy
Pettee
, , O
a
Merrill
Lynch
analyst
. . O

But
USAir
might
not
want
to
help
Mr
Steinhardt
, , O
he
adds
. . O

In
1987
, , O
USAir
Chairman
Edwin
Colodny
stonewalled
when
Trans
World
Airlines
Chairman
Carl
Icahn
threatened
to
take
over
the
carrier
. . O

Mr
Icahn
, , O
a
much
more
practiced
raider
than
Mr
Steinhardt
, , O
eventually
sold
a
big
USAir
stake
at
a
tiny
profit
through
Bear
, , I
Stearns
. . O

Mr
Steinhardt
also
could
take
that
route
. . O

He
confers
big
trading
commissions
on
Wall
Street
firms
. . O

However
, , O
with
airline
stocks
cratering
, , O
he
might
not
get
a
very
good
price
for
his
shares
, , O
traders
say
. . O

Especially
galling
for
Mr
Steinhardt
, , O
say
people
close
to
him
, , O
is
that
USAir
's
Mr
Colodny
wo
n
even
take
his
telephone
calls
. . O

While
USAir
is
n
considered
absolutely
takeover
, , O
its
defenses
, , O
including
the
sale
in
August
of
a
12
% NN
stake
in
the
company
to
Mr
Buffett
's
Berkshire
Hathaway
, , O
are
pretty
strong
. . O

USAir
's
deal
with
Mr
Buffett
`` `` O
was
n
exactly
a
shining
example
of
shareholder
democracy
, , O
'' '' O
Mr
Steinhardt
says
. . O

Since
last
April
, , O
the
investor
has
made
seven
so
13D
filings
in
USAir
, , O
as
he
bought
and
sold
the
company
's
stock
. . O

Such
disclosures
of
big
holdings
often
are
used
by
raiders
to
try
to
scare
a
company
's
managers
, , O
and
to
stir
interest
in
the
stock
. . O

But
of
course
it
would
be
highly
unusual
for
an
investment
fund
such
as
Steinhardt
Partners
to
take
over
a
company
. . O

USAir
and
Mr
Buffett
wo
n
talk
about
Mr
Steinhardt
at
all
. . O

Analysts
say
USAir
has
great
promise
. . O

By
the
second
half
of
1990
, , O
USAir
stock
could
hit
60
, , O
says
Helane
Becker
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
. . O

She
thinks
traders
should
buy
the
stock
if
it
tumbles
to
35
. . O

But
meanwhile
, , O
USAir
is
expected
to
show
losses
or
lackluster
profit
for
several
quarters
as
it
tries
to
digest
Piedmont
Airlines
, , O
which
it
acquired
. . O

Moreover
, , O
some
investors
think
a
recession
or
renewed
airfare
wars
will
pummel
airline
stocks
in
coming
months
. . O

However
, , O
Mr
Steinhardt
says
he
's
`` `` O
comfortable
holding
USAir
as
an
investment
. . O
'' '' O

While
he
has
bought
and
sold
some
USAir
shares
in
recent
days
, , O
he
says
that
contrary
to
rumors
, , O
he
has
n
tried
to
unload
his
holding
. . O

Mr
Steinhardt
adds
that
he
bought
USAir
stock
earlier
this
year
as
`` `` O
part
of
a
fundamental
investment
in
the
airline
group
. . O
'' '' O

In
1989
, , O
Mr
Steinhardt
says
he
made
money
trading
in
Texas
Air
, , O
AMR
and
UAL
. . O

Overall
, , O
his
investments
so
far
this
year
are
showing
gains
of
about
20
% NN
, , O
he
adds
. . O

Does
Mr
Steinhardt
regret
his
incursion
into
the
takeover
game
? . O

People
close
to
the
investor
say
that
was
an
experiment
he
is
unlikely
to
repeat
. . O

`` `` O
I
do
n
think
you
'll
find
I
'm
making
a
radical
change
in
my
traditional
investment
style

'' '' O
Mr
Steinhardt
says

Addington
Resources
Inc
said
it
called
for
redemption
on
Nov
21
its
$ $ I
25
million
outstanding
of
8
% NN
convertible
subordinated
debentures
due
2013
. . O

The
debentures
were
issued
in
the
face
amount
of
$ $ B
46
million
on
July
11
, , I
1988
, , O
the
Ashland
, , I
Ky
, , I
coal
mining
, , I
water
transportation
and
construction
company
said
. . O

The
company
said
the
redemption
is
permitted
because
the
price
of
Addington
's
stock
has
equaled
or
exceeded
$ $ B
19
for
20
consecutive
trading
days
, , O
a
condition
set
in
the
terms
of
the
debentures
. . O

Debenture
holders
are
expected
to
convert
most
of
the
debentures
into
common
because
the
value
of
the
stock
received
in
a
conversion
would
exceed
the
$ $ I

redemption
price
. . O

Commodore
International
Ltd
said
it
will
report
a
loss
for
the
first
quarter
ended
Sept
30
because
sales
of
personal
computers
for
the
home
market
remained
weak
in
some
major
countries
. . O

That
will
mark
the
second
consecutive
quarterly
loss
for
Commodore
and
will
raise
additional
questions
about
whether
it
can
sustain
the
turnaround
it
had
seemed
to
be
engineering
. . O

Commodore
, , O
West
Chester
, , O
Pa
, , O
had
said
in
August
that
it
was
consolidating
manufacturing
to
cut
costs
and
expected
to
be
profitable
in
the
fiscal
first
quarter
. . O

Commodore
said
that
its
announcement
is
based
on
preliminary
information
and
that
the
situation
could
look
different
by
the
time
final
results
are
announced
early
next
month
. . O

In
fact
, , O
Commodore
's
fiscal
fourth
loss
was
$ $ B
2
million
narrower
than
Commodore
had
expected
a
few
weeks
after
the
quarter
closed
. . O

Still
, , O
even
results
approaching
break
would
mark
a
sharp
weakening
compared
with
fiscal
1989
first
earnings
of
$ $ B
9
million
, , O
or
30
cents
a
share
, , O
on
sales
of
$ $ B
200
million
. . O

Reflecting
concerns
about
Commodore
's
outlook
, , O
its
stock
has
plunged
more
than
50
% NN
since
May
, , O
closing
yesterday
unchanged
at
$ $ B
8
a
share
in
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
. . O

The
price
can
be
expected
to
erode
further
, , O
because
the
loss
estimate
came
after
the
market
closed
. . O

Commodore
has
seemed
to
be
setting
the
stage
recently
for
progress
in
the
U
, , O
where
its
personal
sales
have
been
so
dismal
for
years
that
Commodore
is
close
to
dropping
off
research
firms
' POS
market
charts
. . O

Commodore
has
assembled
an
experienced
management
team
, , O
it
has
persuaded
many
more
dealers
to
carry
its
products
and
it
has
unleashed
a
slick
advertising
campaign
. . O

But
those
represent
long
strategies
that
probably
wo
n
succeed
quickly
, , O
even
if
they
turn
out
to
be
the
right
ones
. . O

In
the
meantime
, , O
the
strategies
will
increase
expenses
. . O

Commodore
had
been
counting
on
its
consumer
business
to
stay
sufficiently
healthy
to
support
its
efforts
in
other
areas
-- : O
mainly
in
getting
schools
and
businesses
to
use
its
Amiga
, , O
which
has
slick
graphics
yet
has
been
slow
to
catch
on
because
it
is
n
compatible
with
Apple
Computer
Inc
or
International
Business
Machines
Corp
hardware
. . O

But
sales
to
consumers
have
become
difficult
during
the
past
several
months
, , O
even
in
West
Germany
, , O
which
has
been
by
far
Commodore
's
strongest
market
. . O

The
Commodore
64
and
128
, , O
mainly
used
for
children
's
educational
software
and
games
, , O
had
surprised
market
researchers
by
continuing
to
produce
strong
sales
even
though
other
low
personal
computers
now

In

activity

they
saw
little
of

battered
the

recently

`` `` O
I
did

expect
it

re
their

the

`` `` O
